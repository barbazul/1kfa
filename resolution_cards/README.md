# The cards

Here's how to create the cards:
(this should work on Linux and Mac.  For MS Windows or other platforms,
you'll probably have to port all the paths, especially the `/tmp` paths)

This creates all the square cards:
`python process.py`

This creates the moves, the equipment, and the magic item cards:
`python process_tall.py`

This creates the character cards:
`python process_char.py`
