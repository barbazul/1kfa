## Character Creation

Lay out the cards with an A, B or C in the corner

Tell the players they can choose 3 cards.

They may only choose 1 A card each.

They may only choose 2 B cards each.

As they are thinking about which cards to choose, go around and ask these
questions:


Player 1: What species is your character, human, or something else?

Player 2: Does your character steal things, or do they respect the
concept of private property?

Player 3: Before the adventure starts, is your character engaged in
any kind of profession?

Player 4: Does your character believe in gods? Is there some kind of
religious practice or religious organization for them?

Player 5: Does your character enjoy the outdoors, or city life? Are
they extreme in that preference?

Player 6: Roughly how old is your character?  Have they ever killed
a man before?

Even if the players finish picking cards, finish asking all these questions.
the goal is to get everyone thinking about how *each* of these questions
applies to *their* character, so they don't all just make murder-hobos.


# Home / Comfort

Before the game begins, ask each player where their character feels most
at home, or what their favourite activity is.

Use this information to get your first point in your *Good Bank*, by
starting the story out in a place of normalcy, life, and comfort.  Remember,
it doesn't have to be a Hobbit hole.  Characters might be most at home
in the middle of a bloody battle.
