# GM Guide

## Start Script

Hi everyone! We're going to play Deckahedron World.  This is going
to be really fun, I'm glad you could join me for this!  I'm reading
directly from a script that was designed to get us started fast, by
going over just enough of the rules for our first session, so please
pay attention now so we can get to the fun of the game quickly!

Deckahedron World is a *narrative* game.

It's a storytelling game where we all collaborate and tell the story
together.

I'm going to be the GM, so I'm going to be responsible for the
events in the world and the side characters (they're called NPCs).

Each one of you is going to play a role, kind of like an actor does.
You're going to have a character and you're going to tell us
everything they think and everything that they say and everything
that they do.

Imagine we're making an awesome adventure movie with swords and magic.
You're the actors just making stuff up as you go, and I'm a combination
of screenwriter and director, trying to make the story exciting
and dramatic and deciding how the scenes go together.

But let me get specific about what I mean when I said that you decide
everything your character *does*. You can't just say "My character Tyrion
runs up to the guy and punches him in the head and his head goes flying
off". You *can* say "My character runs up to the guy and *tries* to punch
his head so that his head goes flying off". See the difference? When you
say something like that, It's my job as the GM to say you've *triggered
a move*. The cards and dice will tell us if the guy's head goes flying
off.

When a *move is triggered*, it's time to use the rules of the game to see
what happens next. Triggering moves is a lot of fun. It's fun to succeed
and it's fun to fail. When you trigger moves you're definitely going to
have an impact on the narrative and we're all going to get surprises when
cards flip and dice roll.

The game isn't all triggering moves though.

Most of this game is talking. I'm going to be asking you questions, you'll
probably have lots of questions for me, and we're going to put everything
together to make a story that's exciting.  It's gonna have adventure,
battles, chases, and discovery. It's a fantasy story, so think dangerous,
and take risks. Try to be true to your character's personality.

Each session will be about 3 hours.  We might spend a long time bouncing
ideas off one another and dealing with each consequence in an
improvisational way, or we might be in a long battle with lots of dice
rolling and card flipping. There's no predetermined story, we're all in this
together, and we're going to play to find out what happens.

This first session will need about 30 minutes of prep, though.  Ten minutes
has already gone by with this speech (it's almost over).  Next we're going to
play Sarrukan's Chamber, a pre-made adventure for you to get the hang of the
game. I'll set a timer for 10 minutes and then end Sarukkan's Chamber
abruptly. Then we'll do 10 minutes of Character Creation.

Let's start!

## Character Creation

### Set Expectations

Deckahedron World is a game about a group of scrappy adventurers who
grow to be powers to become reckoned with. Let your players know that.
Establish that their characters will start the game with skills
and gifts beyond ordinary folk, but they'll still have to work to
become really powerful.

### Choose cards

Lay out the cards with an A, B or C in the corner

Tell the players they can choose 3 cards.

They may only choose 1 A card each.

They may only choose 2 B cards each.

#### Choose cards: Alternative rules for first-time players

If this is your players' **first** experience with a role-playing game,
Tell the players to choose only 2 of the A, B or C cards, and have them
also choose a "Risk Driver" card.

Place two green tokens on each player's Risk Driver card.
When their character first *takes a big risk* by the method or
for the reason written on their card, they receive the tokens.

 * Expose an embarrassment
 * Locate a prize
 * Extract a secret
 * Become enamored
 * Sell your services
 * Break down a barrier
 * Choose a side
 * Be an agent of justice
 * Take pity on the desperate
 * Start a grudge
 * Consort with the unsavory
 * Believe an impossible claim
 * Get called out on your boasting


### Add flesh

As they are choosing cards, ask the questions on this list,
one-at-a-time, and make notes from the players' answers.
Don't ask each question to each player, address a question
to just one player, then move onto the next question for
the next player. This exercise gets the players
thinking about their characters, and gets the table talking,
so it's ok for players to blurt out responses out of turn.
This conversation might also add details to the world, like
what kinds of species and religions exist.

 * What species is your character, human, or something else?
 * Does your character steal things, or do they respect the
   concept of private property?
 * Before the adventure starts, is your character engaged in
   any kind of profession?
 * Does your character believe in gods? Is there some kind of
   religious practice or religious organization for them?
 * Does your character enjoy the outdoors, or city life? Are
   they extreme in that preference?
 * Roughly how old is your character?  Have they ever killed
   a man before?
 * What's your character's social standing? When they first
   walk into a room full of people, do they provoke any reaction?

Even if the players finish picking cards, finish asking all these questions.
The goal is to get everyone thinking about how *each* of these questions
applies to *their* character, so they don't all just make murder-hobos.


# Home / Comfort

Before the game begins, ask *every* player where their character feels most
at home, or what their favourite activity is.

Write down the answers.

Use this information to get your first point in your *Good Bank*, by
starting the story out in a place of normalcy, vitality, and comfort.
Remember, it doesn't have to be a Hobbit hole.  Characters might be most at
home in the middle of a bloody battle.

## Fictional Advantages / Disadvantages

In real life, some actions are more difficult than others. The GM has some
tools to reflect this in the game.

There are strict rules.  Be realisitic *and* work within the boundaries.

### Advantages

Let's say a character encounters two guards who, in an earlier scene,
humiliated and bullied him. The player says they're going to use the
Dispense Wrath move.  Because of the narrative set-up, it makes sense that
it should be easier for the character to enter an enraged state.

 - You can hint to the player they already have sufficient narrative set-up
   to Do a Flashback
 - You can use a point from the *Good Bank* to create the advantage - this
   gives flip-3-take-best advantage, and you've only got a few points in
   the *Good Bank*, so make sure it's worth it.
 - You can describe how this narrative situation reinvigorates the character,
   or how they swell with confidence, or how their mind becomes
   clear and focused, and tell the player to regain up to 4 lost Stamina.
   This is at your perogative, and falls under "GM Fiat"
 - You can storytell the situation away.  Maybe the guards run away or
   something happens in the world to avoid the conflict.
   You should get the player's consent because they've already indicated that
   they want to have fun by Dispensing Wrath.

Here is what you can **not** do: you cannot tell them to flip with an
advantage card just because you're the GM and you think it makes sense.

If an advantage is to be had, the price must be paid, either by the
GM or by the player.

### Disadvantages

Let's say the party of adventurers is in a dark cave at nighttime and
no torches are lit.
A multi-winged bat creature swoops down at them, claws slashing. The first
player declares they're going to dive out of the way (Defy Danger with DEX).
Because of the set-up, it makes sense that this will be more difficult than
if the character could clearly see the creature and the ground they're diving
to.

 - You can use 2 points from the *Bad Bank* to create one level of disadvantage

Its important to not get into a situation using this that makes the game seem
unfair. For example, if a second creature swooped down at the next party
member and the *Bad Bank* was now empty, ask yourself how to make it fair when
the second character dives out of the way, free of disadvantage.

# Session 2 rules

Your players at this point will be realizing that they fail often, maybe more
than they'd like. This is a good time to talk about the odds with your players
and particularly to discuss generating advantages.

Some psychological studies have shown that odds feel "fair" only
when players get wins 60% of the time. Now look at the Deckahedron
statistics reference.  You'll see that if your players are mostly doing
standard flips (flips without advantage), they are likely to feel the game
is unfair.

Explain to your players that getting good at playing Deckahedron World
means *creating advantages*. There are built-in moves like
Discern Realities, Defend, Do a Flashback, and Good Thing I Brought that
can be used to create advantages. In this session, explain each one of
these moves.  Discern Realities should be particularly
encouraged if you'd like more opportunities to describe the world,
environment, and NPCs that you're creating.
