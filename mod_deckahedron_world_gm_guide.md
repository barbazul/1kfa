# GM Guide

## Character Creation

Lay out the cards with an A, B or C in the corner

Tell the players they can choose 3 cards.

They may only choose 1 A card each.

They may only choose 2 B cards each.

As they are thinking about which cards to choose, go around and ask these
questions:


Player 1: What species is your character, human, or something else?

Player 2: Does your character steal things, or do they respect the
concept of private property?

Player 3: Before the adventure starts, is your character engaged in
any kind of profession?

Player 4: Does your character believe in gods? Is there some kind of
religious practice or religious organization for them?

Player 5: Does your character enjoy the outdoors, or city life? Are
they extreme in that preference?

Player 6: Roughly how old is your character?  Have they ever killed
a man before?

Even if the players finish picking cards, finish asking all these questions.
the goal is to get everyone thinking about how *each* of these questions
applies to *their* character, so they don't all just make murder-hobos.


# Home / Comfort

Before the game begins, ask each player where their character feels most
at home, or what their favourite activity is.

Use this information to get your first point in your *Good Bank*, by
starting the story out in a place of normalcy, life, and comfort.  Remember,
it doesn't have to be a Hobbit hole.  Characters might be most at home
in the middle of a bloody battle.

## Fictional Advantages / Disadvantages

In real life, some actions are more difficult than others. The GM has some
tools to reflect this in the game.

There are strict rules.  Be realisitic *and* work within the boundaries.

### Advantages

Let's say a character encounters two guards who, in an earlier scene,
humiliated and bullied him. The player says they're going to use the
Dispense Wrath move.  Because of the narrative set-up, it makes sense that
it should be easier for the character to enter an enraged state.

 - You can hint to the player that this is sufficient narrative set-up to Do
   a Flashback
 - You can use a point from the *Good Bank* to create the advantage - this gives
   highest level advantage, and you've only got a few points in the *Good Bank*,
   so make sure it's worth it.
 - You can describe how this narrative situation reinvigorates the character,
   or how they swell with confidence, or how their mind becomes
   clear and focused, and tell the player to regain up to 4 lost Stamina.
   This is at your perogative, and falls under "GM Fiat"

Here is what you can **not** do: you cannot tell them to flip with an
advantage card just because you're the GM and you think it makes sense.

### Disadvantages

Let's say a character is in a dark cave at nighttime and no torches are lit.
A multi-winged bat creature swoops down at them, claws slashing. The player
declares they're going to Defy Danger with DEX and dive out of the way.
Because of the set-up, it makes sense that this will be more difficult than
if the character could clearly see the creature and the ground they're diving
to.

 - You can use one point from the Bad Bank to create one level of disadvantage


# Session 2 rules

Your players at this point will be realizing that they fail often, maybe more
than they'd like. This is a good time to talk about the odds with your players
and particularly to discuss generating advantages.

Some psycological studies have shown that players think odds are "fair" only
when they get to 60% / 40% win versus lose. Now look at the Deckahedron
statistics reference.  You'll see that if your players are mostly doing
standard flips (flips without advantage), they will begin to feel the game
is unfair.

Explain to your players that getting good at playing Deckahedron World
means *creating advantages*. There are built-in moves like
Discern Realities, Defend, Do a Flashback, and Good Thing I Brought that
can be used to create advantages. In this session, explain each one of
these moves.  Discern Realities should be particularly
encouraged if you'd like more opportunities to describe the world,
environment, and NPCs that you're creating.

# Campaigns

In Deckahedron World, there are 3 different kinds of Campaigns:

 * One-shot (usually 3 hours)
 * 9-hour
 * 30-hour

The stories you will tell by playing Deckahedron World are told in 3 parts,
a beginning, middle, and end. These parts are also known as Act 1,
Act 2, and Act 3.

If you're accustomed to other RPGs, having a campaign that *ends* might
feel a little weird. You're advised to try it out first and see the
results you get after a 9-hour campaign, and don't worry, Deckahedron
World allows you to stretch beyond 30 hours if you really want that.

Deckahedron World is designed to tell a particular kind of story.
It's called *The Hero's Journey* by people who study story structure.

*The Hero's Journey* structure is what gives many successful and popular
movies and books their shape: Star Wars, The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings,
Die Hard, Beowulf, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the list goes on.
To help you guide your players through a
successful and popular *campaign*, Deckahedron World gives the GM
a *Good Bank* and a *Bad Bank* and specific rules for using them.

## One-Shot Campaign

 * Act 1
     * Start in a place of normalcy / comfort
     * Cross a threshold with a true choice
 * Act 2
     * Take a thing and pay its (mortal?) price
 * Act 3
     * Return to the surface, changed.

In a One-Shot campaign, there are 4 potential *Good Bank* points the
GM can earn.

### Start in a place of normalcy / comfort

The first point in your good bank is a "gimmie". If you can think of a
way to start all of the player's characters in a place of normalcy /
comfort, mark a point in your *Good Bank*. You did remember to follow
the rules in the Character Creation where you should ask the players
where their characters feel most at home, right?

### Cross a threshold with a true choice

As the game progresses, the conversation at the table will start
establishing details about the world and about relationships between
characters. Look for areas of tension and try to develop it.  Push characters
into discomfort and higher stakes. Then look for a *threshold*. A line that
once crossed, you can't simply turn around and go back. Find a way to
put the characters up against that threshold.

**But don't push them through.**

See if the players choose to step their characters through the threshold.
If all of them cross the threshold and step away from comfort and safety
into a world of danger and adventure, mark yourself another point in the
*Good Bank*.

### Take a thing and pay its (mortal?) price

Give the players an opportunity to earn something *epic* for their characters.
It can be a great treasure, it can be fame and reknown, it can be weaponry, a
magical boon, it can even be self confidence.  It can be an appreciation for
the power of friendship. (Pixar and Disney have some *incredibly* well-done
Hero's Journey stories. Don't discount them because they're animated.)

It's important not to create a prize that just seems cool to you. The prize
should follow from the fiction. It should be something that is actually
wanted or needed by the players' characters.  Pay attention to them, they
are the protagonists in an epic. What would be miraculous for them to receive?

Take that prize and put it somewhere hard to get.

It could be at the end of a road of trials, or inside the cave where they
must conquer their greatest fear, or in the clutches of their most powerful
adversary. Whatever the fictional set-up, draw a box around **all** of the
points currently in your *Bad Bank* and use them all before the characters
get a chance to Rest.

If you can do this, when they complete the challenge that used up the last of
the set aside *Bad Bank* points, give them the prize of Act 2 and give
yourself a point in your *Good Bank*

This is usually the part of the game where characters lose all of their
Stamina and "die". That's ok. You can choose to make a gritty story and let
the deaths stand, or you can see the chapter on spending *Good Bank* points
to make death less than it seems.

### Return to the surface, changed.

In Act 3, find a way to return the characters "home". It need not be their
literal home, nor does it need to be where the adventure started,
geographically.  Go back to that original statement the character made
about their character's place of comfort, and tease apart what makes that
feel like "home" for them. Guide them back into a place that has the same
feeling at its core.

But they are changed. They have been on an adventure, they've seen things,
done things. They are masters of a new way of existing, unafraid of crossing
into the previously uncomfortable world beyond their "home".

Mark your final *Good Bank* point if you can hit this note.
