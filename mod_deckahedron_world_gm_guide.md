# GM Guide

## Character Creation

Lay out the cards with an A, B or C in the corner

Tell the players they can choose 3 cards.

They may only choose 1 A card each.

They may only choose 2 B cards each.

As they are thinking about which cards to choose, go around and ask these
questions:


Player 1: What species is your character, human, or something else?

Player 2: Does your character steal things, or do they respect the
concept of private property?

Player 3: Before the adventure starts, is your character engaged in
any kind of profession?

Player 4: Does your character believe in gods? Is there some kind of
religious practice or religious organization for them?

Player 5: Does your character enjoy the outdoors, or city life? Are
they extreme in that preference?

Player 6: Roughly how old is your character?  Have they ever killed
a man before?

Even if the players finish picking cards, finish asking all these questions.
the goal is to get everyone thinking about how *each* of these questions
applies to *their* character, so they don't all just make murder-hobos.


# Home / Comfort

Before the game begins, ask each player where their character feels most
at home, or what their favourite activity is.

Use this information to get your first point in your *Good Bank*, by
starting the story out in a place of normalcy, life, and comfort.  Remember,
it doesn't have to be a Hobbit hole.  Characters might be most at home
in the middle of a bloody battle.

## Fictional Advantages / Disadvantages

In real life, some actions are more difficult than others. The GM has some
tools to reflect this in the game.

There are strict rules.  Be realisitic *and* work within the boundaries.

### Advantages

Let's say a character encounters two guards who, in an earlier scene,
humiliated and bullied him. The player says they're going to use the
Dispense Wrath move.  Because of the narrative set-up, it makes sense that
it should be easier for the character to enter an enraged state.

 - You can hint to the player that this is sufficient narrative set-up to Do
   a Flashback
 - You can use a point from the Good Bank to create the advantage - this gives
   highest level advantage, and you've only got a few points in the Good Bank,
   so make sure it's worth it.
 - You can describe how this narrative situation reinvigorates the character,
   or how they swell with confidence, or how their mind becomes
   clear and focused, and tell the player to regain up to 4 lost Stamina.
   This is at your perogative, and falls under "GM Fiat"

Here is what you can **not** do: you cannot tell them to flip with an
advantage card just because you're the GM and you think it makes sense.

### Disadvantages

Let's say a character is in a dark cave at nighttime and no torches are lit.
A multi-winged bat creature swoops down at them, claws slashing. The player
declares they're going to Defy Danger with DEX and dive out of the way.
Because of the set-up, it makes sense that this will be more difficult than
if the character could clearly see the creature and the ground they're diving
to.

 - You can use one point from the Bad Bank to create one level of disadvantage


# Session 2 rules

Your players at this point will be realizing that they fail often, maybe more
than they'd like. This is a good time to talk about the odds with your players
and particularly to discuss generating advantages.

Some psycological studies have shown that players think odds are "fair" only
when they get to 60% / 40% win versus lose. Now look at the Deckahedron
statistics reference.  You'll see that if your players are mostly doing
standard flips (flips without advantage), they will begin to feel the game
is unfair.

Explain to your players that getting good at playing Deckahedron World
means *creating advantages*. There are built-in moves like
Discern Realities, Defend, Do a Flashback, and Good Thing I Brought that
can be used to create advantages. In this session, explain each one of
these moves.  Discern Realities should be particularly
encouraged if you'd like more opportunities to describe the world,
environment, and NPCs that you're creating.
