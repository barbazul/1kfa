## Character Creation

Lay out the cards with an A, B or C in the corner

Tell the players they can choose 3 cards.

They may only choose 1 A card each.

They may only choose 2 B cards each.

As they are thinking about which cards to choose, go around and ask these
questions:


Player 1: What species is your character, human, or something else?

Player 2: Does your character steal things, or do they respect the
concept of private property?

Player 3: Before the adventure starts, is your character engaged in
any kind of profession?

Player 4: Does your character believe in gods? Is there some kind of
religious practice or religious organization for them?

Player 5: Does your character enjoy the outdoors, or city life? Are
they extreme in that preference?

Player 6: Roughly how old is your character?  Have they ever killed
a man before?

Player 7: What's your character's social standing? When they first
walk into a room full of people, do they provoke any reaction?

Even if the players finish picking cards, finish asking all these questions.
the goal is to get everyone thinking about how *each* of these questions
applies to *their* character, so they don't all just make murder-hobos.


# Home / Comfort

Before the game begins, ask *every* player where their character feels most
at home, or what their favourite activity is.

Write down the answers.

Use this information to get your first point in your *Good Bank*, by
starting the story out in a place of normalcy, vitality, and comfort.
Remember, it doesn't have to be a Hobbit hole.  Characters might be most at
home in the middle of a bloody battle.

## Fictional Advantages / Disadvantages

In real life, some actions are more difficult than others. The GM has some
tools to reflect this in the game.

There are strict rules.  Be realisitic *and* work within the boundaries.

### Advantages

Let's say a character encounters two guards who, in an earlier scene,
humiliated and bullied him. The player says they're going to use the
Dispense Wrath move.  Because of the narrative set-up, it makes sense that
it should be easier for the character to enter an enraged state.

 - You can hint to the player they already have sufficient narrative set-up
   to Do a Flashback
 - You can use a point from the *Good Bank* to create the advantage - this
   gives flip-3-take-best advantage, and you've only got a few points in
   the *Good Bank*, so make sure it's worth it.
 - You can describe how this narrative situation reinvigorates the character,
   or how they swell with confidence, or how their mind becomes
   clear and focused, and tell the player to regain up to 4 lost Stamina.
   This is at your perogative, and falls under "GM Fiat"
 - You can storytell the situation away.  Maybe the guards run away or
   something happens in the world to avoid the conflict.
   You should get the player's consent because they've already indicated that
   they want to have fun by Dispensing Wrath.

Here is what you can **not** do: you cannot tell them to flip with an
advantage card just because you're the GM and you think it makes sense.

If an advantage is to be had, the price must be paid, either by the
GM or by the player.

### Disadvantages

Let's say the party of adventurers is in a dark cave at nighttime and
no torches are lit.
A multi-winged bat creature swoops down at them, claws slashing. The first
player declares they're going to dive out of the way (Defy Danger with DEX).
Because of the set-up, it makes sense that this will be more difficult than
if the character could clearly see the creature and the ground they're diving
to.

 - You can use 2 points from the *Bad Bank* to create one level of disadvantage

Its important to not get into a situation using this that makes the game seem
unfair. For example, if a second creature swooped down at the next party
member and the *Bad Bank* was now empty, ask yourself how to make it fair when
the second character dives out of the way, free of disadvantage.

# Session 2 rules

Your players at this point will be realizing that they fail often, maybe more
than they'd like. This is a good time to talk about the odds with your players
and particularly to discuss generating advantages.

Some psychological studies have shown that odds feel "fair" only
when players get wins 60% of the time. Now look at the Deckahedron
statistics reference.  You'll see that if your players are mostly doing
standard flips (flips without advantage), they are likely to feel the game
is unfair.

Explain to your players that getting good at playing Deckahedron World
means *creating advantages*. There are built-in moves like
Discern Realities, Defend, Do a Flashback, and Good Thing I Brought that
can be used to create advantages. In this session, explain each one of
these moves.  Discern Realities should be particularly
encouraged if you'd like more opportunities to describe the world,
environment, and NPCs that you're creating.
