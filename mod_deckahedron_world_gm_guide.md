# GM Guide

This guide is intended for a Deckahedron World Game Master (GM).

Read this guide if you are the volunteer among your friends to run the
game. Your responsibilities are:

 * know, teach, and follow the rules
 * tell the lion's share of the story
 * give Non-Player Characters (NPCs) names, voices, motivations,
   and behaviour
 * confront the players with challenges and dangers
 * take notes
 * and...

The last responsibility is so important it deserves its own paragraph:

The players will signal the *kinds* of fun they want to have. It is
your responsibility to notice these signals and insert that kind of
fun into the game.

---

To make your job of teaching the rules easier, this guide has
**scripts**. The scripts are written to be read by you to the players
at the table.

Before sitting down with your group of players, you should read all
the rules.


# First Session

If there is a player at the table who has never played Deckahedron
World before, read the Start Script and play Sarukkan's Chamber.

## Start Script

```
Hi everyone! We're going to play Deckahedron World.  This is going
to be really fun, I'm glad you could join me for this!  I'm reading
directly from a script that was designed to get us started fast, by
going over just enough of the rules for our first session, so please
pay attention now so we can get to the fun of the game quickly!

Deckahedron World is a *narrative* game.

It's a storytelling game where we all collaborate and tell the story
together.

I'm going to be the GM (it's short for Game Master), so I'm going
to be responsible for the events in the world and the side characters
(they're called NPCs or Non-Player Characters).

Each one of you is going to play a role, kind of like an actor does.
You're going to control one character. You get to tell us everything
they think and everything that they say and everything that they do.

Imagine we're making an awesome adventure movie with swords and magic.
You're the actors just making stuff up as you go, and I'm a combination
of screenwriter and director, trying to fill the story with excitement
and drama and also deciding how the scenes go together and where the
camera cuts to next.

But let me pause for a minute and get specific about what I mean by
"you decide everything your character *does*".

You can't just say "My character Tyrion runs up to the bad guy and
punches him in the head and his head goes flying off".
You *can* say "My character runs up to the bad guy and *tries* to punch
his head hard enough to send it flying off". See the difference? When you
describe an action where there's some uncertainty like that, It's my job
as the GM to say you've *triggered a move*. The rules will resolve the
uncertainty and tell us if the bad guy's head actually goes flying off.

When a *move is triggered*, it's time to use the cards and dice to see
what happens next. Triggering moves is a lot of fun. It's fun to succeed
and it's fun to fail, because even in failure, new exciting stuff starts
happening. When you trigger moves, you impact the narrative, consequences
happen, and we're all going to get surprises when cards flip and dice roll.

The game isn't all triggering moves though.

Most of this game is talking. That's why "Say Stuff" is written so boldly
on the character sheets. I'm going to be asking you questions, you'll
probably have lots of questions for me, and we're going to put everything
together to make an epic story. It's gonna have adventure, battles, chases,
discoveries, and magic.

It's a fantasy story, so think dangerous, and take risks.

Be true to your character's personality. Remember it's sort of like acting.

Your character will start out as a scrappy adventurer, and rise in power
to become a hero. Or villian. Or maybe they'll just die in the attempt.
And maybe they'll be resurrected after that.

Each session will be about 3 hours.  We might spend a long time bouncing
ideas off one another and dealing with each consequence in an
improvisational way, or we might engage in a long battle with lots of dice
rolling and card flipping.

There's no predetermined story, we're all in this together, and we're
going to play to find out what happens.

This first session will need about 40 minutes of preparation, though.
Ten minutes has already gone by with this speech (it's almost over).

Next, we're going to play Sarrukan's Chamber, a pre-made adventure for
you to get the hang of the rules. I'll set a timer for 10 minutes and
then end Sarukkan's Chamber when it goes off.

Then we'll take 10 minutes to create a Touchstone List for our game.

Then we'll do 10 minutes of Character Creation.

And then, the adventure begins.

Let's start!
```

## Sarukkan's Chamber

Give each player a Deckahedron.

```
Here's a stack of 20 cards, it's called a Deckahedron.
Notice the 4 different colored symbols on the edges.  They're named
Anchor (red), Bulb (yellow), Crescent (green), and Dart (blue).
When you *trigger a move*, I'm going to instruct you to flip the top
card of your Deckahedron, and we'll see the result on the flipped-over
side. There are 4 possible results:

  * ✔✔ : this means you succeed at the thing you tried
  * ✔ : this usually means something good happens, but maybe with a downside
  * ✗ : this usually means something "ok", or not-so-good happens
  * ✗✗ : this usually means that I get to say what happens and make my own move

When I ask you to flip, I'm going to say something like "flip Anchors"
or "flip red" or "flip green". That means you find the result
on the edge that has that color or symbol.

When you flip it over, please face that edge towards me, so it's easy for
me to read.

Let's try it: everybody put your Deckahedron on the table and flip yellow.
```

Step the players through "flipping yellow" using the instructions in the
[Player's Guide](mod_deckahedron_world.md)

Make sure each player understands how to execute a flip before you proceed.

Give each player a Move Booklet

```
Here are the basic moves.  You don't have to read this booklet unless you
want to. I'll point out moves when they're triggered and we can read them
together or you can just let me apply them.

It's hard for me to do everything though, so the more you can help me out,
the smoother the game will run.

The move you'll be triggering the most will probably be Defy Danger, that's
why it's on the first page. The moves in the back of the booklet are
"downtime" moves which we won't need until much later.
```

Start a timer for 10 minutes.

Next, ask the players these 3 questions. This is an improvisation exercise.
Its purpose is to get the creative juices flowing and to signal to the
players that they have input over the story.

Ask the players for the name of a medieval fantasy city name.
Write down the answer. That will be the name of the setting.

Ask "What's a store where women buy clothing?". Use that to create the
female protagonist's name. (eg, "Forever 21" can turn into "Forva",
"La Senza" can turn into "Senza")

Ask "What's a city in Europe?". Create the male protagonist's name with
that. (eg, "Paris" can just be "Paris", London can be "Donalo")

Distribute a player card to each player and ask them to write down the
names you just came up with.

Whenever you need to invent names, try asking the players these
kinds of questions - start with an unrelated topic like "What's something
you buy at a grocery store?", "What's my mother's favourite TV show?".


Next, instruct the players to fill out the stat boxes like so:

 * Both characters have 1 Int (Anchor)
 * The female protagonist has 3 Dex (Crescent) and 2 Str (Bulb)
 * The male protagonist has 2 Dex (Bulb) and 3 Str (Crescent)

### 3rd PC variant

If you've got a 3rd player at the table, add a guard character.

Ask "What's a domestic brand of beer?". Use that to create the 3rd
character's name. The guard can be any gender, has 3 Int, 2 Str, and 1 Dex.

Let them know that they'll get introduced about 5 minutes into the story.

### Introduce Sarrukan's Chamber

Begin narrating the set-up.

```
[Addressing her]
_ (female protagonist), you are an acrobat.
Your troupe of performers set off on the road to perform in the big
city _ (city name). You were really excited, because your big brother lives
there, and you haven't seen him since you were 13, and that was 10 years
ago.

But your excitement soon turned to horror and despair. On the road, your
troupe was overrun by masked horsemen. They attacked fiercely and without
mercy. All the women of the caravan were captured, and by the cries and
what you glimpsed through your stained blindfold, all the men were slain.

You remember one phrase uttered by the marauders,
"Deliver them to Sarrukan."

After days of travel shackled in a box, you found yourself imprisoned in
a small, dark, musty cellar room. Windowless, the only illumination is
whatever lamplight filters through the cracks of the door.

[Dramatic pause]

[Addressing him]
_ (male protagonist) you are a thief-catcher.
You're not too bright, but your boss, Gandlin, has taken you under his
wing and taught you street wisdom. Merchants employ him to recover stolen
valuables or they pay for simple retribution against the pilfering
scoundrels. You provie the muscle. Gandlin sniffs them out, you beat
them up, and each shares in the reward.

That's how it had been. Gandlin has now gone missing.

He was investigating a series of thefts from
private homes. There was some pattern to it -- artifacts or books taken,
but no smashed windows or doors. The mystery of it had Gandlin
obsessed, working sometimes until dawn.

Then one dawn it was he that was taken, with a trail of blood to
tell of it. Following the path, you came to the locked gate to the yard
behind Sarrukan's estate. Sarrukan was a powerful player in _ 's (city name)
noble circles, but not much was known of him.

After jumping the wall, you didn't get much farther before you were
surprised from behind and knocked out, waking up in a tiny, dirt-floored
room in the cellar.

[Addressing both]
But tonight, something changed. It was noisy tonight. Footsteps and
conversations could be heard upstairs. It was some kind of party.
And there were no guard patrols of the cellars. In parallel, but
without bumping into each other, you both used the lapse to escape.

You freed yourself from your cell.

In some dark corner you grabbed a reveler and took their elaborate
costume and mask for a disguise. Tonight must be a masquerade ball.

With no easy opportunity to exit, you kept evading attention by going
upstairs, until you reached the third floor.

From different doors, you simultaneously enter an empty bedchamber. You
turn from the door you carefully and silently closed to see across the
room, an apparent party guest in full wardrobe.

[Dramatic pause]

One last thing, with these masks on, you don't know this, but you're
brother and sister.

What do you do?
```

### 3rd PC variant - Introduce the reluctant guard

After the first to PCs have had a chance to inspect their
surroundings, and maybe have a dialogue with each other, introduce the
3rd PC

```
[Addressing guard]
_ (guard), you are a guard.
You're the newest hire in Sarukkan's staff, but you're already thinking of
changing careers. There's some sketchy stuff going on here. You're not too
sure what exactly, since you mostly patrol the yard, but you're sure you
heard the sounds of women crying when you patrolled near the cellar door
a couple days ago.

You got called into the house just now.  Apparently a guest of the ball
had been assaulted and stripped of their clothing.  The culprit might still
be inside, so Yogran, a fellow guard pulled you to help him investigate.

One other thing, Sarukkan is rumoured to be a practicioner of dark magic
and all staff are forbidden to enter his chamber. You think Yogran is going
to use you as a guinea pig to do just that.
```

### Details - take them or leave them

 * Luxurious canopy bed in the middle
 * Chamber is full of esoterica - books, sculptures, votives
 * Maybe a window at the front of the room - an escape route?
 * An alarm triggers when a guard enters the room?


### Goals for Sarrukan's Chamber

Ideally, Sarukkan's Chamber should demonstrate what kind of game
Deckahedron World is.

 * Get each player to have an opportunity to do a Deckahedron flip
 * **Stack the decks** this scene is for instruction, so put the Critical
   Success card at position 3 in all players' decks.
 * Let the PCs have some dialogue, but when it feels like they're hesitating,
   push quickly to the approaching danger of the guards.
 * Get the guards into the room for a quick fight.
 * Try to get the PCs to attempt *Hack & Slash* or *Volley*
 * As the PCs gain the upper hand, show signs of another threat (maybe
   the wizard himself approaches - it's ok to tell the story of what's
   happening *off-camera*), and then cut it off with a cliffhanger.
 * Go back into the rules instruction after no more than 10 minutes.
 * Play Sarukkan's Chamber *honestly*. Set the stakes the same as you would
   when you play a campaign
 * If any PvP happens, remember to use the PvP rules

The players should now understand how the Deckahedron works with character
stats to produce results that affect the narrative.

### Get into a fight

Playing Sarrukan's Chamber should include some combat, so here's the simple
way to execute a fight scene.

Grab a piece of paper and write down the names of each opponent.  Beside
their name, draw ticks for their Stamina points.  Beside that, write their
attack power die (d2, d4, d6, d10).

Opponents' Stamina points should be realistically scaled to the "scrappy
adventurer" level of the players. This table should help.

|                   | Stamina points |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Dotards, Children | 2 |
| Civilians         | 4 |
| Bouncers, Guards  | 5-6 |
| Trained Soldiers, Elite Guards  | 7-10 |

Generally, human opponents will have d2 attack power when unarmed and d4
attack power when armed. Save greater attack powers for monsters and special
villians.

Use your descriptions to give cues about how tough the enemies are.

In combat, it's ok if play gets more formulaic.  Some players enjoy
the "abnegation" of a tit-for-tat combat scene that lasts tens of minutes.
This can be a combination of exciting and relaxing.  Give your players
opportunities to press their favourite buttons.

That said, some players don't seek abnegation. What kinds of signals are
your players giving you? Maybe they want to get through combat faster. If
so, when you make your moves, you can think cinematically. Continually raise
the stakes for both sides during the scene. Think dangerous. No character
or set piece needs to be safe or sacred.

Combat can play out in whatever way feels natural and follows from the
fiction.  That said, it can be taxing on a GM to come up with new, creative
responses in combat because flips are happening frequently. So, to relieve
some of that pressure on the GM, here are some formats available to follow
to get you through a fight scene.

#### Format 1

This format is simple, and gives the players the most agency.

  - Give each player a "turn" where they will probably trigger an agressive
    combat move like Hack & Slash or Volley
  - Pay attention to IMMEDIATE combat moves that may have triggered
  - Execute the moves, make cool stuff happen as consequences
  - Go around the table until all the opponents flee or are incapacitated
  - Any ✗✗ results may usually be interpreted as "your enemies attack". Choose
    some opponents that weren't *just* in a Hack & Slash, and declare they
    attack one of the player's characters. Apply attack power against that
    character. Use an attack power die from one attacker, and add 1 attack
    power for each other attacker

#### Format 2

This format makes the opponents more of a threat.

  - Give each player a "turn" where they will probably trigger an aggressive
    combat move like Hack & Slash or Volley, call that a "player round"
  - Pay attention to IMMEDIATE combat moves that may have triggered
  - After player turns are complete, and the players look to you to see
    what happens next, execute an "NPC round"
  - Identify the opponents that didn't interact during the "player round"
  - Describe how all of those opponents team up on one of the player's
    characters, and call for one Defy Danger flip.
    (move the "danger" spotlight fairly, but also try to put pressure on any
    players with more than 3 green tokens)
  - Failing the Defy Danger flip results in the player's character suffering
    the opponents' attack. You can calculate attack power thusly:
      * ✗✗ : one attack power die from the lead attacker,
        and add 1 attack power (not die) for each other attacker
      * ✗ : no attack power die,
        but 1 attack power per attacker (so 3 foes = 3 attack power)

#### Format 3

This format imagines the opponents as particularly quick and aggressive.

  - Give each player a "turn" where they will trigger a move
  - Pay attention to IMMEDIATE combat moves that may have triggered
  - When describing the outcome of a player's move, also describe how the
    opponents take agressive action.
  - Keeping the spotlight on that player, have them respond to the actions
    of their foes, usually by needing to follow their first flip with a
    Defy Danger flip.
  - Allow players to avoid the opponent's aggressive action if their first
    flip specifically provided for it, and it makes sense in the narrative.
    (See Backstab, Bum Rush, Volley)


# Begin a Campaign

## Establish Touchstones

First, the table needs to get on the same page about the adventure's setting,
themes, and tone.

### Step 1

Brainstorm some cultural "touchstones". Ask everyone to call out titles of
books, movies, games, comics, and TV shows that feel inspiring, and write
them all down, no matter how silly.  Everyone at the table can add as many
titles as they want.

### Step 2

Each player gets a chance to circle *one* of the titles on the list.

Remind the players that Deckahedron World has rules for swords and limited
magic, and no rules for machine guns or interstellar travel. So choosing
sci-fi touchstones might help with themes and tone, but won't have much to
offer for establishing setting.

This list of circled titles becomes the "touchstone list".

### Step 3

The GM, using their knowledge of the rules, should read the list and
call out any potential conflicts between circled titles and the rules of
Deckahedron World.

Will the players expect their characters to pull off the same feats
and use the same powers of the chosen touchstones?

*Die Hard* is a great touchstone for tone, themes, and relationships, but
Deckahedron World doesn't have rules for helicopters or machine guns.

The GM should not *reject* any circled titles, they should just address
what's going to be possible.

Everyone will have more fun if expectations are set at the beginning.


### The Touchstone List

Invite players to imagine what kind of world would be the one where all
the circled titles are mashed together. What does this world look like?
What are it's dominant features? What secrets are hidden away in the small
places? Who are the folk that populate it, do their children happily play
in the sun? What monsters lurk, what weakness do the ambitious and
powerful exploit?

It's not necessary to answer these questions, just to start thinking.

The "touchstone list" may be consulted when the table needs to make a
judgement about whether an action should be possible. You can ask the
question "Would this kind of thing be possible in _ ?" (fill in the name
of one of the titles in your touchstone list).

The touchstone list is also an early way that the players can signal
to the GM the kind of fun they want to have.


## Character Creation

### Create a GM sheet

The GM needs a sheet of paper to make notes and track information.

At the top of the sheet write the headings "Good Bank" and "Bad Bank".
Leave enough space to track the points under each of those headings.


### Set Expectations

Deckahedron World is a game about a group of scrappy adventurers who
grow to be powers to become reckoned with. Let your players know that.
Establish that their characters will start the game with skills
and gifts beyond ordinary folk, but they'll still have to work and
struggle through adversity to become really powerful.

### Choose cards

Lay out the cards with an A, B or C in the corner

Tell the players they can choose 3 cards.

They may only choose 1 A card each.

They may only choose 2 B cards each.

#### Choose cards: Alternative rules for first-time players

If this is your players' **first** experience with a role-playing game,
Tell the players to choose only 2 of the A, B or C cards, and have them
also choose a "Risk Driver" card.

Place two green tokens on each player's Risk Driver card.
When their character first *takes a big risk* by the method or
for the reason written on their card, they receive the tokens.

 * Expose an embarrassment
 * Locate a prize
 * Extract a secret
 * Become enamored
 * Sell your services
 * Break down a barrier
 * Choose a side
 * Be an agent of justice
 * Take pity on the desperate
 * Start a grudge
 * Consort with the unsavory
 * Believe an impossible claim
 * Get called out on your boasting


### Add flesh

As they are choosing cards, ask the questions on this list,
one-at-a-time, and make notes from the players' answers.
Don't ask each question to each player, address a question
to just one player, then move on, asking the next question to
the next player. This exercise gets the players
thinking about their characters, and gets the table talking,
so it's ok for players to blurt out responses out of turn.
This conversation might also add details to the world, like
what kinds of species and religions exist.

 * What species is your character, human, or something else
   from our Touchstone List?
 * Does your character steal things, or do they respect the
   concept of private property?
 * Before the adventure starts, is your character engaged in
   any kind of profession?
 * Does your character believe in gods? Is there some kind of
   religious practice or religious organization for them?
 * Does your character enjoy the outdoors, or city life? Are
   they extreme in that preference?
 * Roughly how old is your character?  Have they ever killed
   a man before?
 * What's your character's social standing? When they first
   walk into a room full of people, do they provoke any reaction?

Even if the players are done picking cards, finish asking all these questions.

The goal of the Q&A is to get everyone thinking about how *each* of these
questions applies to *their* character, so they don't all just make
1-dimensional murder-hobos.

As you're asking these questions, you should also be checking their
expectations. Deckahedron World is a game where characters start off as
scrappy adventures.  If a player is telling you their character is a fire
demon or a ten year old shoe shine boy or a computer hacker, a
conversation is needed to establish how that character can fit into
the Deckahedron World rules.

If a player's character reads as too exotic, that might be the player
signaling that the fun they want to have is playing a different game.


### Home / Comfort

Before the game begins, ask *every* player where their character feels most
at home, or what their favourite activity is.

Write down the answers.

Use this information to get your first point in your *Good Bank*, by
starting the story out in a place of normalcy, vitality, and comfort.
Remember, it doesn't have to be a Hobbit hole.  Characters might be most at
home in the middle of a bloody battle.


# GM Rules

These rules are split up into sessions. During the first 3-hour session,
the players will probably just be getting the hang of the the flow of the
game. In session 2, they will probably experience downtime, and be ready
to understand how moves interact with each other.

## Session 1 Rules

## Fictional Advantages / Disadvantages

In real life, some actions are more difficult than others. The GM has some
tools to reflect this in the game.

There are strict rules.  Be realisitic *and* work within the boundaries.

### Advantages

Let's say a character encounters two guards who, in an earlier scene,
humiliated and bullied him. The player says they're going to use the
Dispense Wrath move.  Because of the narrative set-up, it makes sense that
it should be easier for the character to enter an enraged state.

 - You can hint to the player they already have sufficient narrative set-up
   to Do a Flashback
 - You can use a point from the *Good Bank* to create the advantage - this
   gives flip-3-take-best advantage, and you've only got a few points in
   the *Good Bank*, so make sure it's worth it.
 - You can describe how this narrative situation reinvigorates the character,
   or how they swell with confidence, or how their mind becomes
   clear and focused, and tell the player to regain up to 4 lost Stamina.
   This is at your perogative, and falls under "GM Fiat"
 - You can storytell the situation away.  Maybe the guards run away or
   something happens in the world to avoid the conflict.
   You should get the player's consent because they've already indicated that
   they want to have fun by Dispensing Wrath.

Here is what you can **not** do: you cannot tell them to flip with an
advantage card just because you're the GM and you think it makes sense.

If an advantage is to be had, the price must be paid, either by the
GM or by the player.

### Disadvantages

Let's say the party of adventurers is in a dark cave at nighttime and
no torches are lit.
A multi-winged bat creature swoops down at them, claws slashing. The first
player declares they're going to dive out of the way (Defy Danger with DEX).
Because of the set-up, it makes sense that this will be more difficult than
if the character could clearly see the creature and the cave floor they're
diving into.

 - You can use 2 points from the *Bad Bank* to create one level of disadvantage

This level of disadvantage should now be applied *consistently* whenever any
character attempts to avoid a swooping attack in a dark environment from a bat
creature without further expenditure from the Bad Bank.

Consistency prevents players from feeling the game is unfair or that you are
especially aiming negative consequences at them.

# Session 2 rules

## Prepare

*Before* your next session starts, you should run through the events of the
previous session in your head. Think especially about signals you got from the
players. What kind of fun did each player seem to seek out or respond to? Was
a player particularly keen to create backstory, to get into combat, to ask
a lot of questions about how the world works? Can you think of things to go
into the next session to provide that kind of fun?

Think about the plot and how to get your next couple points in the Good Bank.
Do you think the characters will make certain decisions? You might imagine 2
or 3 key decisions the party will be confronted with. For every fork in the
road, try to imagine how the world and NPCs will respond when the characters
choose either branch.

That's important. Prepare for *either* case.

There is no *correct* answer for the characters. Never punish a player for
making a choice you didn't expect.

No game ever goes according to your imagination. The purpose of preparation
is to use your imagination to assemble a cabinet of narrative spices. Wait
until you play to find out what happens.


## Give Hints

After session 1, your players will be realizing that they fail often, maybe more
than they'd like. This is a good time to talk about the odds with your players
and particularly to discuss generating advantages.

Some psychological studies have shown that odds feel "fair" only
when players get wins 60% of the time. Now look at the Deckahedron
statistics reference.  You'll see that if your players are mostly doing
standard flips (flips without advantage), they are likely to feel the game
is unfair.

Explain to your players that getting good at playing Deckahedron World
means *creating advantages*. There are built-in moves like
Discern, Defend, Do a Flashback, and Good Thing I Brought that
can be used to create advantages. In this session, explain each one of
these moves.  Discern should be particularly encouraged if
you'd like more opportunities to describe the world, environment, and
NPCs that you're creating.

## Apologia

After running through the events of last session in your mind, you may
realize you're painted into a corner. When the characters are in a
situation where you can't imagine a way to keep the game exciting,
you need to have a conversation with your players.

Retroactively edit.

Collaborate.

Get consent.


## Good Bank and Bad Bank

### Moves tagged IMMEDIATE

### Deus Ex Machina

#### Create Advantage
#### Resurrect a Character
#### An NPC to the rescue

# Create A Combat Encounter

## Balance

This is just guidelines

You have power - it's mostly in the narrative

What kind of GM move do you do in response to failed flips?

Calculate party power, create set of enemies that challenge them to
the desired degree

 * 10 Stamina Points for each PC
 * If a player has > 4 green tokens, add X

Always describe the encounter in a way that hints at the difficulty.

 * The two guards *exchange an unsure look and step forward*
 * The salty pirate flashes his blade, but *simultaneously takes a step
   backwards towards his ship*

 * The golem is *gargantuan and covered in scars from many battles*
 * The *horde* of undead wolves stare at you with *unrelenting hunger*
 * The old man with the walking stick is *unfazed by your threats* and,
   *after looking you up and down, turns away with an air of dismissal*

# Loot

Let the characters find whatever you think would be most fun.

Sometimes you don't know what loot is appropriate.

If the characters slay a pack of werewolves, and ask to search the bodies,
and you don't immediately have a great idea about what kind of beneficial
gear could be found on nearly naked bodies, you can write "What we found
on the werewolves" on a blank card, and give it to one of the players.
Tell them to place a token from their SPEED pile on the card.
Later in the game, when the rules demand either a WEALTH or EQUIP to be
spent, the "What we found on the werewolves" card may be spent, if the
players can justify it.


[Campaigns](mod_deckahedron_world_campaigns.md)

# Start of Session

Ask each player for either a thing they learned about the world or a way
they expressed their character's personality. If they can give a resonably
correct answer, give them a green token.

Tell each player about what content you added last session in response
to a signal you got from them.  If they *all* agree that you correctly
