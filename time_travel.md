# Time Travel Convention

Lookup "Continuum"

A time travel LARP
 * This LARP *is* the screening process for the time travel society
 * Just as Continuum was
   * That's possible because time travel is a force that transcends boundaries like "capitalism"
 * The reason you're reading this is because someone playing this game will become a time traveller, and either you're one of them, or it was necessary for them to play with *you* to create the specific timeline where they became that time traveller.
 * Their future selves (me! hello!) made sure of that. When time isn't a boundary, you can kinda do what you want in these realms.
 * Confused? It only really makes sense when you consider the "meta-fractal" of information.
 * Reality is a fountain of ever-generating information.  It "tries" everything that's possible, and information configurations that self-perpetuate, do so. A branch containing the time dimension was one of these configurations. It *birthed* time. When you become a time traveller, you are free to move in the time dimension, but you still exist inside the boundaries of the meta-fractal.
 * The meta-fractal is like an infinitely growing tree. Sometimes a branch on a tree dies, but the whole tree keeps on growing. You don't want to be one of those branches destined to die, because unlike time (you'll understand this later), the meta tree goes on forever, and nobody wants to be dying forever.
 * One known way that branches die is by "paradoxes" \*\*. So, we don't "create paradoxes". That's another reason why you're finding out this way, because it was one of the ways that didn't create a paradox.
 * Ugh, it is so aggrivating to say "create paradox" - it's a poor abstraction - don't learn that too deeply.  The actual truth will be explained later.
 * This is in the form of a LARP because 1. that's what we were into at the time, and 2. the game teaches the basic skills I'll need to build the "time machine"\*
 * I'm being vague about who I am because it's important that I not know I'm a time traveller at this point, otherwise I wouldn't have become one.
 * But I am telling the truth. It's one of these weird rules that emerges, actually. I have no choice but to, time travellers can't lie to other time travellers. It would "c" a "p".


* Which is a dumb way of saying it, but that's a shorthand way to phrase it thatmakes sense to my brain at this stage. Saying what it actually was wouldn't make any sense to me and wouldn't attract my attention.

** Ugh, another one of these.


 * Here's the rub - you can never prove if you're on a branch that's dying, because, on the meta-fractal, that proof would be the same thing as causing a paradox.


# Rules

 * Go into a room of 4-6 other people, who have all agreed to play, and convince them you know more about time travelling than one other person in that room.
 * Do this regularly.  Do it in different locations, and do it with different groups of people.
 * Leave the room in "exactly two hours". Refrain from any convincing rhetoric for "exactly one hour"
 * The purpose of the game is:
   * Oh, look!  I put those two phrases in quotation marks! Almost as if the relationship between "rules" and "time" are important!  Maybe that's a clue!
   * You will need to convince people. This will start teaching you how hard it is, but also how rewarding when you actually succeed.
   * This game will force you to educate yourself.
   * This game will inspire ideas that are necessary for the "time machine"
   * Being who you are will mean a certain kind of lonliness, and this is hard to hear and to write. But this game does actually work, and you will *really* need to be able to cope.
   * One purpose of the game is a secret. Aren't I a mysterious bullet point? Aren't I a redundant question mark?
 * Convince other people to play the game.
