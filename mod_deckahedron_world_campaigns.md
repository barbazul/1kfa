# GM Guide - Campaigns

In Deckahedron World, there are 3 different kinds of Campaigns:

 * One-shot (usually 3 hours)
 * 9-hour
 * 30-hour

The stories you will tell by playing Deckahedron World are told in 3 parts:
beginning, middle, and end.

If you've played other RPGs that *don't have endings*, ones that go on for
months or even years, this might seem weird to you.
Don't worry, try out a 9-hour campaign and see the results.
You may find your doubts erased. And don't worry, Deckahedron World allows
you to stretch beyond 30 hours if you really want that.

Deckahedron World is designed to tell a particular kind of story.
It's called *The Hero's Journey* by people who study story structure.

*The Hero's Journey* is a skeleton upon which many successful and popular
movies and books are arranged: Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The Breakfast
Club, Die Hard, Beowulf, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the list goes on.
To help you execute a successful and popular *campaign*, Deckahedron
World gives the GM a *Good Bank* and a *Bad Bank* and specific rules for
using them.

# One-Shot Campaign

 * Act 1
     * Start in a place of normalcy / comfort
     * Cross a threshold with a true choice
 * Act 2
     * Take a thing and pay its (mortal?) price
 * Act 3
     * Return to the surface, changed.

In a One-Shot campaign, there are 4 potential *Good Bank* points the
GM can earn.

## Start in a place of normalcy / comfort

The first point in your good bank is a "gimmie": If you can think of a
way to start all of the players' characters in their place of normalcy or
comfort, mark a point in your *Good Bank*. You *did* remember to follow
the rules in the Character Creation and ask the players where their
characters feel most at home, right?

## Cross a threshold with a true choice

As the game progresses, the conversation at the table will start
establishing details about the world and about relationships between
characters. Look for areas of tension and try to develop it.  Push characters
into discomfort. Raise the stakes. Then look for a *threshold*. Look for
some line that once crossed, they can't simply turn around and go back.
They might enthusiastically seek it out, they might even cross over before
you've even figured out what it should be (if so, all that's left for you is
to mark yourself a point in the *Good Bank*). But you might also
need to increase the pressures in their "home" to gently nudge the characters
up against that threshold.

But, if you want that point, **don't push them through.**

See if the players choose to step their characters through the threshold.
If all of them cross the threshold and step away from their ordinary world
into a mysterious world of danger and adventure, mark yourself another point
in the *Good Bank*.

## Take a thing and pay its (mortal?) price

Give the players an opportunity to earn something *epic* for their characters.
It can be a great treasure, it can be fame and reknown, it can be weaponry, a
magical boon, the elusive respect of an NPC, it can even be self confidence.
It can be an appreciation for the power of friendship. (Pixar and Disney have
some *incredibly* well-done Hero's Journey stories. Don't discount them
because they're animated.)

It's important not to create a prize that just seems cool to you, the GM.
The prize should follow from the fiction. It should be something that is
actually wanted or needed by the players' characters. Pay attention to them,
they are the protagonists in an odyssey. What would be miraculous for them to
receive?

Maybe you don't have to *create* the prize at all. What have the players
been talking about, is there already a specific goal? What themes have already
emerged through the action, dialogue, and relationships?

Take that prize and put it somewhere hard to get.

It could be at the end of a road of trials, or inside the cave where they
must conquer their greatest fear, or in the clutches of their most powerful
adversary.

### Alot Bad Bank Points

Whatever the fictional set-up, when you're ready, set up a challenge in
the narrative, then draw a box around **all** of the points currently in
your *Bad Bank* and use them all before the characters get a chance to Rest.

If you can do this, when they complete the challenge that used up the last of
the set-aside *Bad Bank* points, give them the prize of this mysterious world,
and give yourself a point in your *Good Bank*.

### Death Is Real Here

This is the part of the game where characters are most at risk to lose all
of their Stamina points. In other stages of the story, the GM may choose to
narrate this as unconciousness, imprisonment, or something else that
the character will naturally recover from.

But not in this stage.

If the character loses all their Stamina in this stage of the story, the GM
should represent this as "death". Sell it as a permanent removal of the
character, and by extension, the player from being able to impact the events
of the story.

Don't make this a downer for the player though. Make the death epic.
Give the character a final stand that saves the day, or gives the other party
members a chance to survive an enormous threat. A moment of tremendous,
meaningful sacrifice. Look for what the character symbolized, or what niche
they filled in the party's personality, and amplify that symbol or personality
aspect to be everyone's salvation.

Also realize you can give them a second chance at life. If you don't want a
gritty, hardcore vibe in your campaign, you don't have to let the death stand.
Have a look at the chapter on spending *Good Bank* points to resurrect a
character.

## Return to the surface, changed.

In the final stage, find a way to return the characters "home". It need not
be their literal home, nor does it need to be where the adventure started,
geographically. Go back to that original statement the players made
about their character's place of comfort, and tease apart what makes that
feel like "home" for them. Guide them back into a situation that has the same
feeling at its core.

But they are changed. They have been on an adventure, they've seen things,
done things. They are now masters of a new way of existing, unafraid of
crossing into the previously alien world beyond their "home".

By dialogue or action, each player character should exhibit their change.

This can play out in many ways:

 * by using their newfound power to deal with the bullies that previously
   tormented them
 * though they dutifully swore to their holy order to keep this quest secret,
   when they travel back through the badlands, they share the seeds of the
   foreverfruit with the impoverished village that showed them hospitality
 * by not screwing up for once in the eyes of their family, and delivering
   the elves' ointment to cure their grandfather of Medusa's curse
 * by re-igniting the war as they were bade, like a good soldier, but then
   returning to challenge their clan-lord for leadership
 * by being cast out of yet another city, but this time they're on the road
   with mirth in their step and a horse pulling sixteen barrels of mead

Mark your final *Good Bank* point if you can hit this note.

## It's ok to skip it

You don't need to get every point in your *Good Bank*. You should especially
not try to force it if doing so would sacrifice fun for the players. Remember,
you're not the only author of this story, and while earning points feels nice,
you've got other jobs too, like paying attention to the signals the players
give you for the kind of fun they want to have.

## The lengths vary

The final part might go very fast, or it might be a long journey home.
The first threshold might be crossed so fast that you only notice after the
fact.
Taking the prize might involve a twisting road of trials, or it might be
one explosive boss battle.

Let the story be what it must be, and *play to find out what happens*, but
also take your opportunities to earn *Good Bank* points when they arise.



# 9-hour Campaign

## Start in a place of normalcy / comfort AKA "You"

In the 9-hour campaign, start the game just like you would in the One-shot
campaign.

## Call to adventure AKA "Need"
`TODO`

 * Provide a sandbox to play in, let the players establish what their
   characters value here in the sandbox
   * It could be a thing, but it could also be a theme - freedom,
     progress, peace, etc

 * Show something valuable is threatened (maybe the known world)

 * Herald or Message - the unknown world threatens something valuable.

 * Show a threat or challenge that they cannot *yet* overcome
   * That may mean they are defeated by it
     * They **need** more power
   * Maybe a spell or skill is needed
     * They **need** more power
   * Maybe knowledge is needed
     * They **need** information from the unknown world
   * Maybe their place of comfort is exposed as insufficient
     * lacking to provide for their growing desires or curiosity

 * Be honest about this threat. If they fight something they cannot defeat
   and don't retreat, incapacitation, even deathâ€  is an option.

 * Impossible threat comes alongside a suggestion of hope
   * "Maybe the oracle will know"
   * "Great Hero perished in the badlands, but maybe his sword survived"
   * Herald makes a promise
   * You can be a small part of the solution if you come with me

 * This threatening force will progress no matter the characters' choices
   and will pervade the story as a "front".

 * This is important: *the characters _need_ the things they will get when
   the players _play_ the game*
