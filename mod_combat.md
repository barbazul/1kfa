# Deckahedron Module: Combat

The Combat Module tells you when your character is able to endure
exertion and injury to keep moving forward and tells you when your
character is completely spent and collapses in a heap.

## Stamina / Exhaustion

Characters have 10 Stamina points.  These points are represented by
cards in your Deckahedron with a Stamina symbol

![Image of card with Stamina](images/front_19_200.png)
This card has a Stamina symbol in the center.

![Image of card without Stamina](images/front_3_200.png)
This card does not have a Stamina symbol.

When a character is in a fight, they are running, dodging, striking, and
being struck and assailed by their foe.  All of this stuff is scary and
exhausting. So a character will get weaker the longer they're in this
exchange, even if they're dodging every blow. The Combat Module represents
this by action failures causing the player to lose their "good cards" during
a fight.

To win a combat, a character's foes must be subdued or pacified before the
player's Deckahedron has been emptied of Stamina points.

When you are instructed to lose a Stamina point:

 * flip cards in your Deckahedron until you find a card with a Stamina symbol
 * Stop flipping and put that card aside, face up in your "Exhaustion pile"
 * (You can put an Exhaustion marker on top of this pile to help you remember)

(So, if you were instructed to lose 3 Stamina points, you'd add 3 cards
with Stamina symbols onto your Exhaustion pile)

Note: Players *may* reshuffle their discard pile back into the Deckahedron
before searching for Stamina points. Additionally, if insufficient Stamina
points were found in the inital search, the player **must** reshuffle their
discard pile into the Deckahedron and search again.

If there are no Stamina points in your Deckahedron *or* your discard pile,
then your character is *incapacitated* and can take no further actions.
It is up to the Storyteller to decide what this
incapacitation means - whether the character is dead, unconscious, or just
unable to stand or move.

## Taking a Breather

*Taking a breather* is an action that a character can take during combat.
This action allows a character to regain Stamina points.

The player can use either Intelligence or Dexterity to perform the *Take a
Breather* action.

If they use Intelligence, they say how they execute a tactic or
recognize a favourable position that lets them gather their breath
and their wits. Then they flip a card.

If they use Dexterity, they say how they maneuver into a safe position
that offers some temporary safety. Then they flip a card.

 * On a ✔✔ they regain 1d4 Stamina
 * On a ✔ they regain 1d4 Stamina, but their foe moves to a superior position
 * On a ✗ they regain 1 Stamina, but their foe moves to a superior position
 * On a ✗✗ they regain nothing and their foe moves to a superior position

## Lasting Harm: Strains / Sprains / Bruises

Strains, sprains, and bruises are meant to represent either bodily harm
or mental strain that is so significant that the negative effects will last
for a while.

When you are instructed to take a Strain, sprain, or bruise:

 * the Storyteller will describe what kind of harm this represents
 * Lose a Stamina point
 * Place a *Harm token* on your *Exhaustion pile*
  * **Unless:** if there's already 2 Harm tokens on your *Exhaustion pile*:
   * take a *Wound* instead

## Resting

*Resting* is an action that a character can take when they are out of combat,
not travelling, and have several hours to devote to rest (sleeping qualifies).

 * Remove one *Harm token* from your *Exhaustion pile*
 * Count the remaining *Harm* and *Wound* tokens on your *Exhaustion pile*
 * Choose that many cards from your *Exhaustion pile* at random and put them
   back in the pile
 * All the rest of the cards get shuffled back into your Deckahedron

Note: Time devoted to *Resting* cannot also be devoted to learning skills,
studying with a teacher, or any other action that takes mental or physical
effort.

## Wounds

Getting wounded sucks, and when wounded, all intelligent creatures seek
to cure their condition as a very high priority.

When you are instructed to take a Wound:

 * **If you already have 2 wounds** the character is incapacitated
 * **Otherwise**:
  * the Storyteller will describe how you were wounded
  * Lose a Stamina point
  * Place a *Wound token* on your *Exhaustion pile*
  * Place a *Wound card* in your *discard pile*. It will now start cycling
    between your Deckahedron and your discard pile.

![Image of Wound card](images/wound_200.png)

Having a *Wound card* in your Deckahedron causes some nasty effects.

Whenever you flip and reveal a wound card (ie, when resolving an attempt):

 * Tell or act out the gutteral noise emitted by your character
 * You must immediately stop flipping (eg, if your skill or the
   action instructed you to "flip 3", you would stop short once you hit
   the wound card)
 * Lose a stamina point

## Healing

*Healing* is an action that a character can take when they are in a peaceful
environment and have time and resources to spend on self-care.

Eg, if they are in a primitive camp posessing medicine men or a
contemporary city with doctors and hospitals or a tranquil oasis infused
with healing magic.

Healing can also be effected by equipment and skills.
See [Equipment](mod_equipment.md) and [Characters](mod_characters.md)

When you spend a day healing:

 * Describe your character's healing experience
 * Remove one *Wound token* from your *Exhaustion pile*
 * Remove all *Harm tokens* from your *Exhaustion pile*
 * Count the remaining *Wound* tokens on your *Exhaustion pile*
 * Choose that many cards from your *Exhaustion pile* at random and put them
   back in the pile
 * All the rest of the cards get shuffled back into your Deckahedron

As with *Resting*, time spent *Healing* cannot also be used in activities that
take effort.

## Attacking: Unopposed flips

Any attack where the foe is caught unaware is done by an unopposed flip.
The player taking the action:

 * Flips Dex (ranged weapon) or Str (handheld weapon)
 * On a ✔✔ or ✔, deal 1d4 Damage
 * On a ✗✗ or ✗, miss

In either case, the foe is now aware that the fight is on.

## Attacking: Opposed flips

### Ranged attacks:
This is modeled as a "volley" or "spray" attack.  The player should
account for ammo "points" for their weapon.  One of the consequences
can be to lose one of those ammo points.

In ranged combat is that, even when you don't hit an opponent, you can
cause them to stay in the cover they've got, dive for the floor, or
interrupt their current action.  Here, we'll call this "pinned"

 * Both the attacker and the defender flip Dex

 * ✔✔ v ✔✔ - deal 1d4 damage / foe can choose to move
 * ✔✔ v ✔  - deal 1 damage / foe pinned
 * ✔✔ v ✗  - deal 1d4 damage / foe pinned
 * ✔✔ v ✗✗ - critical hit: 1d4 damage includes a *Harm* token

 * ✔ v ✔✔ - deal 1 damage / foe can choose to move
 * ✔ v ✔  - you choose: 1 damage or foe pinned
 * ✔ v ✗  - you choose: 1d4 damage or foe pinned
 * ✔ v ✗✗ - deal 1d4 damage / foe pinned

 * ✗ v ✔✔ - lose ammo / foe can choose to move
 * ✗ v ✔  - lose ammo
 * ✗ v ✗  - simple miss
 * ✗ v ✗✗ - foe pinned

 * ✗✗ v ✔✔ - lose ammo and lose 1 Stamina
 * ✗✗ v ✔  - lose ammo / foe can choose to move
 * ✗✗ v ✗  - lose ammo
 * ✗✗ v ✗✗ - lose ammo / foe pinned

### Melee attacks:

 * Both the attacker and the defender flip Str

 * ✔✔ v ✔✔ - deal 1d4 damage / foe deals 1d4 damage
 * ✔✔ v ✔  - deal 1d4 damage / foe deals 1 damage
 * ✔✔ v ✗  - deal 1d4 damage
 * ✔✔ v ✗✗ - critical hit: choose: 1d4 + 1 damage or deal a *Wound*

 * ✔ v ✔✔ - deal 1 damage / foe deals 1d4 damage
 * ✔ v ✔  - deal 1 damage / foe deals 1 damage
 * ✔ v ✗  - deal 1d4 damage
 * ✔ v ✗✗ - you choose: deal 1d4 damage or deal a *Harm*

 * ✗ v ✔✔ - you choose: take 1d4 damage or drop a piece of equipment
 * ✗ v ✔  - take 1 damage
 * ✗ v ✗  - clash - get up in their face and say something nasty
 * ✗ v ✗✗ - foe cannot do damage next turn

 * ✗✗ v ✔✔ - take 1d4 damage
 * ✗✗ v ✔  - you choose: take 1d4 damage or drop a piece of equipment
 * ✗✗ v ✗  - pushed to the ground - you cannot do damage next turn
 * ✗✗ v ✗✗ - both are pushed to the ground

## Attacking: Damage

Though it is called "dealing damage", it actually represents the exhaustion
that comes with the physical exhaustion of jumping for cover or swinging
weapons at each other.  The game is made more fun when these acrobatics are
described.

## Other kinds of attacks

The "Ranged" and "Melee" actions described in this document are very simple
and can make for some fun adventures, but after a couple adventures with these
rules, your players might be craving more depth and more mechanical
possibilities.  It's highly recommended that you take a look at additional
modules which overwrite the Attack rules in this base Combat Module.

See the [Equipment](mod_equipment.md),
[Medieval Fantasy](mod_medieval_fantasy.md), and
[Thematic flips](mod_thematic_flips.md)
modules for other kinds of combat rules.

## Rationale for Stamina / Harm / Wounds Mechanics

### Stakes

All actions have consequences, not just the action that takes a character from
"alive" to "dead".

### Visibility

It's easy to see the players' *Exhaustion piles*, and their *Harm* and *Wound*
tokens.
Keeping these facts visible helps the Storyteller add new events with the
right amount of difficulty.
