# Deckahedron World: Start Script

## Introduce the players to the idea of RPGs

 * Narrative & Improv
 * Challenges - use the Deckahedron to find the result
  * ✔✔ means you succeeded at the thing you tried
  * ✔ means something happens, pretty good, but maybe a downside
  * ✗ means something happens, maybe not so good
  * ✗✗ means the GM gets to make a move


## Let's try a 5-minute scene

 * Improv up some names
 * Distribute a player card to each player
  * write the names down
  * everyone starts with 3 speed and 1 weapon
  * randomly distribute stats between 1 and 3 points
 * PCs are all recently escaped prisoners of a wizard
  * who secretly wants to destroy the town
  * townspeople don't know he's an evil wizard, but PCs do
  * the wizard is hosting a masquerade ball right now in his castle
 * PCs all simultaneously enter an empty bedchamber from different doors
  * they didn't escape together so this is the first time they're reuniting
  * but they're all wearing masks & costumes
 * Guards are approaching the bedchamber on the hunt for escapees

### GM Notes

 * Get each player to have an opportunity to do a Deckahedron flip
 * Let the PCs have some dialogue, but push quickly to the approaching
   danger of the guards.
 * Get the guards into the room for a quick fight.
 * Try to get the PCs to attempt *Hack & Slash* or *Volley*
 * As the PCs gain the upper hand, show signs of another threat (maybe
   the wizard himself approaches - it's ok to tell the story of what's
   happening *off-camera*), and then cut it off with a cliffhanger.
 * Go back into the rules instruction after no more than 5-10 minutes.

The players should now understand how the Deckahedron works with character
stats to produce results that affect the narrative.


## Leave off magic rules until session 2

Unless a player really really wants to make a magic-using character, leave
the rules regarding magic items for another session.
