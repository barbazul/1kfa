# Deckahedron Module: Green Scenes

`TODO`

The GM has a deck of "scene" cards:

 * Humour
 * Emotional Depth
 * Callback
 * Action that effects change (+/- system from Save the Cat??)

## Steps:

1.  The GM shuffles these cards and lays them out face-up, behind a screen
so that the players cannot see them.

2. The GM places one green token on one of the cards (either by choice, or
randomly by rolling a d4)

## Play:

When a player takes a turn or otherwise contributes something that
satisfies the card that the token is on, that player gets the token and
puts it on their character sheet.  The GM then does steps 1 and 2 again.

When a player flips a ✗ or ✗✗ on their turn, the GM moves the green token
to the adjacent card.


# Deckahedron Module: Green Stories

The GM has a deck of "story" cards:

### Blake Snyder's Beat Sheet

```
but could also use
* Screenwriter's Bible
* Hero's Journey
* etc.
```

1. Opening Image – A visual that represents the struggle & tone of the story.
   A snapshot of the main character’s problem, before the adventure begins.
2. Set-up – Expand on the “before” snapshot. Present the main character’s world
   as it is, and what is missing in their life.
3. Theme Stated (happens during the Set-up) – What your story is about; the
   message, the truth. Usually, it is spoken to the main character or in their
   presence, but they don’t understand the truth... not until they have some
   personal experience and context to support it.
4. Catalyst – The moment where life as it is changes. It is the telegram, the
   act of catching your loved-one cheating, allowing a monster onboard the
   ship, meeting the true love of your life, etc. The “before” world is no
   more, change is underway.
5. Debate – But change is scary and for a moment, or a brief number of
   moments, the main character doubts the journey they must take. Can I face
   this challenge? Do I have what it takes? Should I go at all? It is the last
   chance for the hero to chicken out.
6. Break Into Two (Choosing Act Two) – The main character makes a choice and
   the journey begins. We leave the “Thesis” world and enter the upside-down,
   opposite world of Act Two.
7. B Story – This is when there’s a discussion about the Theme – the nugget of
   truth. Usually, this discussion is between the main character and the love
   interest. So, the B Story is usually called the “love story”.
8. Fun and Games / The Promise of the Premise –
   This is the fun part of the story. This is when
   Indiana Jones tries to beat the Nazis to the Lost Ark, when the detective
   finds the most clues and dodges the most bullets. This is when the main
   character explores the new world and the audience is entertained by the
   premise they have been promised.
9. Midpoint – Dependent upon the story, this moment is when everything is
   “great” or everything is “awful”. The main character either gets
   everything they think they want (“great”) or doesn’t get what they think
   they want at all (“awful”). But not everything we think we want is what we
   actually need in the end.
10. Bad Guys Close In – Doubt, jealousy, fear, foes both physical and
   emotional regroup to defeat the main character’s goal, and the main
   character’s “great”/“awful” situation disintegrates.
11. All is Lost – The opposite moment from the Midpoint: “awful”/“great”. The
   moment that the main character realizes they’ve lost everything they
   gained, or everything they now have has no meaning. The initial goal now
   looks even more impossible than before. And here, something or someone
   dies. It can be physical or emotional, but the death of something old makes
   way for something new to be born.
12. Dark Night of the Soul – The main character hits bottom, and wallows in
   hopelessness. The Why hast thou forsaken me, Lord? moment. Mourning the
   loss of what has “died” – the dream, the goal, the mentor character, the
   love of your life, etc. But, you must fall completely before you can pick
   yourself back up and try again.
13. Break Into Three (Choosing Act Three) – Thanks to a fresh idea, new
   inspiration, or last-minute Thematic advice from the B Story (usually the
   love interest), the main character chooses to try again.
14. Finale – This time around, the main character incorporates the Theme – the
   nugget of truth that now makes sense to them – into their fight for the
   goal because they have experience from the A Story and context from the B
   Story. Act Three is about Synthesis!
15. Final Image – opposite of Opening Image, proving, visually, that a change
   has occurred within the character.
