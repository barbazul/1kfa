# Deckahedron Module: Green Stories

`TODO`

The GM has a deck of "story" cards:

 * Humour
 * Emotional Depth
 * Callback
 * Action that effects change (+/- system from Save the Cat??)

## Steps:

1.  The GM shuffles these cards and lays them out face-up, behind a screen
so that the players cannot see them.

2. The GM places one green token on one of the cards (either by choice, or
randomly by rolling a d4)

## Play:

When a player takes a turn or otherwise contributes something that
satisfies the card that the token is on, that player gets the token and
puts it on their character sheet.  The GM then does steps 1 and 2 again.

When a player flips a ✗ or ✗✗ on their turn, the GM moves the green token
to the adjacent card.
