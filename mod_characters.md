# Deckahedron Module: Characters


## How to represent a character

A character will be represented by a simple **character sheet** and a
collection of **cards** which represent a richer list of the character's
attributes.

When playing, you should also keep notes for information
about the character that isn't covered by your character sheet and cards.

It can also be fun to draw a picture of the character and keep that handy.

### Character Sheet

A sheet displaying

#### The character's **name**
#### The character's **stats**:
  * **Strength** (STR)
   - This represents the rank of the character's musculoskeletal system
  * **Dexterity** (DEX)
   - This represents the rank of the character's fast twitch muscles, fine motor skills, and reaction time
  * **Intelligence** (INT)
   - This represents the rank of the character's brain (and heart, if you feel so poetic)

Each *stat* has a rank: 1. `Anchor` (red), 2. `Bulb` (yellow),
3. `Crescent` (green), or 4. `Dart` (blue).
The rank of the stat will determine which side of the Deckahedron to flip.

> If your character is attempting deduce their own position using a
> map written in a foreign language, they would do a flip using
> their `intelligence` rank.  Let's say they were a dumb Orc, and their
> `intelligence` was the lowest rank, `Anchor`. They would flip the `Anchor`
> side of the Deckahedron and reveal whether or not they succeeded.

### Character Attribute Cards

A collection of cards describing the "built-in" attributes of your character.
These may be things like "Charming Smile", "Stubborn", "Good Cardio",
"Dwarf", "Elf", "Member of Engineering Guild".

These are usually things that could be called "facts" about a character.

Attribute cards can sometimes provide flip bonuses, or make it easier to
level up in different skills.  They can also weave into the narrative. A
good GM finds ways to make character attributes impact the story.

Unlike `Skill Cards`, `Attribute Cards` don't get better with practice,
and their advantages don't increase and decrease with `bonus` and `penalty`
cards.

### Character Skill Cards

A collection of cards describing the learned skills of the character.
These may be things with obvious analogs in our world like "Swimming" or
"Geometry", or they could be things that require a little bit more
thought to interpret how they matter in the narrative world players create,
like "Dirty Tricks" or "Infiltration". They could also be highly-specific
and highly poetic concepts like "Eye of the Tiger" and "Leeroy Jenkins".

Skill cards generally provide flip bonuses, but can have just about any
mechanical or narrative effect on the game.

#### Getting better with practice

##### Initial skills:

Your character will begin the game already having proficiency in a few
skills.  See the [#how-to-create-a-character] section.

##### Learning a new skill:

##### Becoming proficient:

A character lacks proficiency with a skill when there are `penalty` cards

When you declare you're using a skill and then flip a card to reveal your
result, there may be a green `bonus` symbol in the middle of the card.
(Note: if this was a flip that required you to flip multiple cards and
take the worst result, [INSERT RULE HERE])
When this symbol is present, that means, despite the success or failure,
your practice paid off and you just got a little better at the skill.
