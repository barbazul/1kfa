# Deckahedron Module: Characters


## How to represent a character

A character will be represented by a simple character sheet and a collection
of cards with represent a richer list of the character's attributes.

When playing, you should also have a sheet to keep notes for information
about the character that doesn't fit in your character sheet and cards.

It can also be fun to draw a picture of the character and keep that handy.

### Character Sheet

A sheet displaying

 * The character's **name**
 * The character's **stats**:
  * **Strength** (STR)
   - This represents the rank of the character's musculoskeletal system
  * **Dexterity** (DEX)
   - This represents the rank of the character's fast twitch muscles, fine motor skills, and reaction time
  * **Intelligence** (INT)
   - This represents the rank of the character's brain (and heart, if you feel so poetic)

Each *stat* has a rank: 1. *Anchor* (red), 2. *Bulb* (yellow),
3. Crescent (green), or 4. *Dart* (blue).
The rank of the stat will determine which side of the Deckahedron to flip.

```
If your character is attempting deduce their own position using a
map written in a foreign language, they would do a flip using
their *intelligence* rank.  Let's say they were a dumb Orc, and their
*intelligence* was the lowest rank, *Anchor*. They would flip the *Anchor*
side of the Deckahedron and reveal whether or not they succeeded.
