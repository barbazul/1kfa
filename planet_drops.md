"The enemy gate is down"

You descend, face-first into the fusion-gushing star to absorb enough energy for FTL

Your accelerational compensators whir into action to defend your soft bio-bodies
against the trauma.

Screens off. Stay calm. Resist the urge to find comfort in "seeing where you're going".
The relativistic turtleneck of photons would only unnerve you further.

Your ship must have sufficient integrity to pivot & punch at literally the last second.

You'll be fine; 1s is more than double what your Jury 3-Chip needs to run the calculation.

Don't pray. Don't pray... Damn your dreams! Don't pray, coward!

  * Then you find yourselves (some score) away from the other targeted star system
  * If you fail, you "punch through" - legend says you'll end up in starless,
  inter-galactic space or, only by some miracle, in some other arm of the milky way
  (if it ever happens the players always end up in some other arm)
