# Welcome to Role-Playing

Deckahedron World is a system for telling a story.  The authors of the story
are you and your friends, sitting around a table.

This story is improvisiational, interactive, and collaborative.

The rewards for playing are laughter and excitement while you play, and
warm conversations for years afterwards that start with "Remember that time
we were playing Deckahedron World and..."


## How to make a great story

Imagine the audience for this story is the inner children of all the players.
What evokes the feelings we had when we were children playing pretend? Can
you remember being 11 years old and watching a great Steven Spielberg movie?
Or maybe a crappy Sam Raimi movie?

You are going to collaborate with all the other players to make this story,
so when you add your parts, think of what will give your friends around the
table a thrill, put them in suspense, ratchet up their feelings of tension,
or make their jaws drop with awe.

Sometimes inner children get a big kick out of blood and guts.
Your inner child might be the one who giggled watching the Messandei / Grey
Worm scenes in HBO's Game of Thrones. If you don't know what topics
your friends consider "off-limits", it is a good idea to ask and tell before
you start playing.

The story that emerges from Deckahedron World is not a precisely crafted
thing. That's ok. It doesn't have to be high art or even a cartoon on Adult
Swim. It will get shaped by each player, and when your turn comes, you will
adapt, do your best improvisational "Yes, and", and see where it goes from
there. It might sound like chaos, but with some faith in your friends, you
will delight at how a the plot solidifies, and how real the characters
become.


## Specifically, What to do

Roles - GM, Player

GM: Know all the rules, say stuff.  Your domain is the world.
Players: 50% Say stuff, 25% Flip your Deckahedron, 12% Move tokens around,
12% Roll dice.  Your domain is your character.

Player:

 * Describe your character and their actions
    * Refer to your moves to get ideas for your character
    * Act out their dialogue
    * Tell *how* they act
       - flourishes and stunts
       - their facial expressions, voice, and body language
    * Tell what they say / hear / see / smell / taste / feel
    * Describe their thoughts & memories
    * Chime in when they interact with / support the other characters

 * Tell parts of the story
    * Refer to your moves to see what boundaries you can push
    * Tell your character's backstory
    * Control hirelings and animal companions

# The Deckahedron

Inspect your Deckahedron.  You should have 20 cards.  There will be 4
symbols on the fronts and backs of the cards:

 * Anchor - it is red and inndicates the weakest odds.
   Sometimes called Rank 1
 * Bulb - it is yellow and indicates below average odds.
   Sometimes called Rank 2
 * Crescent - it is green and indicates above average odds.
   Sometimes called Rank 3
 * Dart - it is blue and indicates the best odds.
   Sometimes called Rank 4

Shuffle your Deckahedron and place it face-down in front of you.

Whenever your character attempts something risky, where the outcome is
not certain, the GM will call on you to use your Deckahedron and "flip".

First, the GM will name the move you're attempting and which of your
character's attributes -- Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence -- you
will use to resolve the flip.

![Illustration of rotating your Deckahedron](images/component_rotate.png)

Look at the attribute on your character sheet -- what symbol is it, Anchor,
Bulb, Crescent, or Dart? Rotate your Deckahedron so that that symbol is
facing forward (away from you). Then flip the top card forward (so that
when it's face-up, the symbol is facing forward)

![Illustration of flipping a card forward](images/component_flip.png)

The top of the flipped card will show ✗s or ✔s.

![Illustration of reading a card](images/component_read.png)

Finally, find the move card named by the GM and read its instructions.
It will tell you how you and the GM should interpret the ✗s and ✔s.

### For example,

You're playing a character named Kresk.  You say:

> Kresk sees the pit of spikes in front of him, but isn't scared.
> He just takes a running start and mightily bounds over the pit,
> landing safely on the other side.

The GM might say to you:

> Ok, sounds good, but let's see if Kresk's legs are strong enough.
> Please flip Defy Danger with your Strength.

Look over at the character sheet and see that Kresk has rank 3
(Crescent) Strength. This means you would rotate your Deckahedron
so that the Crescent symbol is forward, then you would flip over
the top card.

Maybe you get a single ✔. The GM would use the instructions on the
Defy Danger card ("You do it, but there's a new complication") to
say what happens next:

> You leap through the air, landing with a thud on the other
> side of the pit, kicking up a cloud of dust on this forgotten
> jungle trail. As you rise to your feet, you notice it's more than
> dust that stirs, as you hear movement and a threatening rattle
> approaching from the pit. What do you do?

### Other ways to flip

    * Take your +1 advantage
    * Use flashbacks: re-flip with green tokens
    * Use the critical flip
    * When you flip a green symbol: take or distribute green tokens
    * When you flip a fatigue symbol: lose stamina



## GM: Examples for what to do on single ✗ results

 * Make a "soft" move
 * Give an opponent an extra Stamina point
 * Give an opponent +1 to the next time they do damage
 * Make a cost a bit more expensive
 * Make a treasure a bit less valuable
 * One of the character's resources gets cosmetically changed
 * **Bank** a point

## GM: Examples for what to do on ✗✗ results

 * Make a "soft" move
 * Make a "hard" move
 * Player loses confidence in the skill they just tried.  Put a white-side red card on it until they use it and flip a ✔ or ✔✔

## GM Moves

 * The Dungeon World moves
 * Increment the difficulty on ✗
 * "Call for an Ad-Hoc Challenge"
  - eg, "Something feels weird about this bridge. Flip Int to notice
    what the problem is"
    (It's implied that either ✔ or ✔✔ are needed to succeed)
  - eg, "Anyone who wants to race to the edge of the bridge before
    it collapses must have at least 2 speed and get ✔✔ on a Dex flip"
    (The GM is allowed to consider other aspects than just Int / Str / Dex)
  - eg, "You're all in the moat. Spend a green token and describe how
    your character learned to swim, or else begin thrashing and drowning.
    If you spend the green token, write 'swimming' on your character
    sheet."

 * On a *critical failure* flip, the GM can use 3 banked points to make
   an additional move


## GM responsibility: moving the spotlight

Never let a player's turn to be inconsequential. A player can't wait
10 minutes for their friends' moves and then their whole turn ends
with "nothing happens". Give them an opportunity for something. This
doesn't mean they have to slay a demon on every turn, merely getting
a big laugh can be "something".

# Combat - Stamina/Harm/Wounds - GM: moving the spotlight

## Stamina

## Harm

## Wounds

# Flipping Green - get a green token

# More Moves - Do a Flashback, Critical Flip

# More Moves - Take a Breather, Rest, Heal

When resting, magic items regain all charges, up to their maximum capacity.
Remove all white-side red cards on your magic items.

# Speed/Equipment/Wealth

## More Moves - Run, Shop, Good Thing I Brought..., Sharpen and Stitch

# Mundane Items

## Armor, weapons

# More Moves - Use a Magic Item, Entreat the Blood-Bound, Channel the Living Light

Ask that player "Who is the Blood-Bound"?

# Starting a game

## Sarukkan's Chamber

## Making your own character

Spread out A, B, C cards, take turns picking

Items - 2 mundane items or 1 magic item

"Use a Magic Item" move gives you 2 magic items

A player will inevitably ask why the magic amulet or ring they've created,
a trinket that would normally be light, reduces their speed.  At that point
the GM should ask them a question, "Yes, why does it weigh you down? What
about magic in this world, or what about your character makes them
especially burdened by magical items?"

# Leveling Up

## Flipping green

## Study / Craft

When crafting a weapon, ask how many red tokens it takes (ie, how much it
reduces a character's speed). The GM should weigh that cost against the
weapon's other features
