# Welcome to Role-Playing

Deckahedron World is a system for telling a story.  The authors of the story
are you and your friends, sitting around a table.

This story is improvisiational, interactive, and collaborative.

The rewards for playing are laughter and excitement while you play, and
warm conversations for years afterwards that start with "Remember that time
we were playing Deckahedron World and..."


## How to make a great story

Imagine the audience for this story is the inner children of all the players.
What evokes the feelings we had when we were children playing pretend? Can
you remember being 11 years old and watching a spectacular Steven Spielberg
movie?  Or maybe a cheap-but-awesome Sam Raimi movie?

You are going to collaborate with all the other players to make this story,
so when you add your parts, think of what will give your friends around the
table a thrill, put them in suspense, ratchet up their feelings of tension,
or make their jaws drop with awe.

Sometimes inner children get a big kick out of blood and guts.
Your inner child might giggle at the brothel scenes in HBO's Game of
Thrones. If you don't know what topics your friends consider "off-limits",
it is a good idea to ask and tell before you start playing.

The story that emerges from Deckahedron World is not a precisely crafted
thing. That's ok. It doesn't have to be high art or even a cartoon on Adult
Swim. It gets shaped by each player, and when your turn comes, you
adapt, do your best improvisational
["Yes, and"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes%2C_and...)
, and see where it goes from there.
It might sound like chaos, but with some faith in your friends, you
will delight at how the plot solidifies, and how real the characters
become.


## Specifically, What to do

In a game of Deckahedron World, one person will take on the role of the
Game Master, or "GM".  The other people will be called simply "Players".

### The GM

The GM's job is to know all the rules, and say stuff.  Occassionally
they will write notes and scribble some quick numerical facts.

The GM's domain is the world.


### The Players

Player, your domain is your character.

![the player's job](images/player_job.png)

Most of your time will be spent saying stuff. You are part of a conversation.
Ask questions, use your imagination, chime in when someone inspires you.
Think about your character like a hero of a movie, and try playing as
the writer of the movie, or the director, or immerse yourself like a method
actor standing in the character's shoes and seeing with their eyes.

Deckahedron World invites you to:

 * Describe your character and their actions
   * Act out their dialogue
   * Describe *how* they act
      - flourishes and stunts
      - their facial expressions, voice, and body language
   * Tell what they say / hear / see / smell / taste / feel
   * Describe their thoughts & memories
   * Chime in when they interact with or support the other characters
   * Refer to your **moves** to get ideas for your character
 * Tell parts of the story
   * Tell your character's backstory
   * Control your character's hirelings and animal companions
   * Refer to your **moves** to see what boundaries you can push

As the conversation unfolds, the rules will chime in as well.  When that
happens you will be called do things beyond just "saying stuff":

 * Flip your Deckahedron
 * Move tokens around
 * Roll dice

This guide will teach you how to do those things.


# The Deckahedron

Every player except the GM gets a Deckahedron. Inspect your Deckahedron.
You should have 20 cards.  There are 4 symbols on the fronts and
backs of the cards:

Name      | symbol                                  | odds                              | color  | rank
----------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------|-------
Anchor    | ![anchor symbol](images/anchor.png)     | indicates the weakest odds        | red    | rank 1
Bulb      | ![bulb symbol](images/bulb.png)         | indicates below average odds      | yellow | rank 2
Crescent  | ![crescent symbol](images/crescent.png) | indicates above average odds      | green  | rank 3
Dart      | ![dart symbol](images/dart.png)         | indicates the best odds           | blue   | rank 4

Shuffle your Deckahedron and place it face-down in front of you.

Whenever your character attempts something risky, where the outcome is
not certain, the GM calls on you to use your Deckahedron and "flip".

First, the GM names the move you're attempting and which of your
character's attributes -- Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence -- you
use to resolve the flip.

    GM Note: The attributes used to resolve a move are listed at the top
    of each card.  Sometimes a card gives the option of several
    attributes, like "Str / Dex".  You may need to ask the player for more
    detail about what they are attempting before calling for a flip.

![Illustration of rotating your Deckahedron](images/component_rotate.png)

Look at the attribute on your character sheet -- what symbol is it, Anchor,
Bulb, Crescent, or Dart?
Take the top card and flip it face up.
Put it down so that the symbol faces the GM.
(Saying "Bam!" or making some other sound effect is optional.)

![Illustration of flipping a card forward](images/component_flip.png)

The top of the flipped card shows ✗s or ✔s.
These tell you the result of the move.
Consistently facing the result towards the GM helps simplify the GM's
bookkeeping and helps the game stay fast-paced.

![Illustration of reading a card](images/component_read.png)

Finally, find the move card named by the GM and read its instructions.
It tells you how the GM should interpret the ✗s and ✔s.

Afterward, any card used during a flip goes face-up in a *discard pile*.
Later, you will start another pile of face-up cards called an
*Exhaustion pile*.  Keep them separate.

## For example,

You're playing a character named Kresk.  You say:

> Kresk sees the pit of spikes in front of him, but isn't scared.
> He just takes a running start and mightily leaps over the pit,
> landing safely on the other side.

The GM might say to you:

> Ok, sounds good, but let's see if Kresk's legs are strong enough.
> Please flip Defy Danger with your Strength.

Look over at the character sheet and see that Kresk has rank 3
(Crescent) Strength. Flip over the top card of your Deckahedron and
look for that Crescent symbol.

Maybe you get a single ✔. The GM uses the instructions on the
Defy Danger card ("You do it, but there's a new complication") to
improvise what happens next:

> You leap through the air, landing with a thud on the other
> side of the pit, kicking up a cloud of dust on this forgotten
> jungle trail. Rising to your feet, you notice that more than
> dust has been stirred. The sounds of movement and a threatening
> rattle alerts you to something approaching from inside the pit.
> What do you do?

## Other ways to flip: Advantage / Disadvantage

Some flips are a little more complicated. Some moves in Deckahedron
World instruct you to "take +1 advantage", "add an advantage card"
or "flip with advantage". Sometimes you are given the opposite
instruction, "add a disadvantage card" or "flip with disadvantage".

### Advantage

With an advantage, flip over your top card as usual, and then
flip over the next card as well.
Compare the results (the number of ✗s or ✔s next to the relevant symbol)
and *resolve the flip* with the card that has the **best** result.

If it's a tie, you may choose whichever card to be the card that *resolves
the flip*.

All cards that got flipped go face-up in your *discard pile*.

#### Complete Flip Rule

You must flip over all the cards you were instructed to, even if the first
card shows ✔✔.


### Disadvantage

With a disadvantage, do the same thing, but use the **worst** result.

### Multiple Advantages / Disadvantages

For a given flip, you may be instructed to add two advantage cards or two
disadvantage cards.  This means you flip **3 cards in total** and take
the **best** or **worst**, respectively.

No flip may use more than 3 cards in total, so adding advantage cards
beyond 2 is just ignored.

Sometimes there's a situation where you are instructed to both
"flip with advantage" and "flip with disadvantage".
To resolve any of these combinations,
simply add up all the advantages, and then subtract all the disadvantages
to arrive at your sum of advantage or disadvantage.
The maximum is still two extra cards, so if the sum is -3, you only
flip with two disadvantage cards.


## Other flip complications: Green token cards

![A green token card](images/component_card_green_token.png)

Some Deckahedron cards have a green token symbol in the middle.
After a flip is resolved by a card showing a green token symbol,
you have a choice:

 * Take a green token from the supply
 (these may be spent later to perform certain moves)
 * Go up one level in the move just performed
 (see [Move Levels](#move_levels))

You may only do this when the card *resolves* a flip. (ie, when flipping
multiple cards, only if the *green token card* was the one from which
the ✗ or ✔ symbols were used to interpret the result of the move)

Green tokens are a currency you spend to activate "meta" parts of the game.
See below for moves that let you "break" or "bend" rules, or partially take
control of the narrative.


## Other flip complications: Wound cards

Sometimes you flip over a Wound card and must lose a Stamina point. See the
[Combat chapter](#combat).


## Reshuffling

At any time before a flip, or after a flip is resolved, you may take your
*discard pile* and shuffle it back into your Deckahedron.

Whenever your Deckahedron is down to 5 or fewer cards, you **must** take
your *discard pile* and shuffle it back into your Deckahedron.


## Interpreting the result of a flip

When a player performs a move, the player executes a flip, and the GM
interprets the narrative result, based on the text of the move card.

![flip results](images/flip_results.png)

Usually ✔✔ means an unfettered success, and single ✔ means success,
but with complication.

When the result is a single ✗, it sometimes means the same as a single ✔,
but often it is slightly worse.

When a flip results in a single ✗, even when the move card says it has the
same narrative effect as a single ✔, the GM should add a point to the
*Bad Bank*.

Sometimes a card does not say how a ✗ should be interpreted.  In that case,
the GM gets to make a move, just like ✗✗.

When the result is ✗✗, it is the GM's turn to make a move. The GM narrates
the consequences of the move the player just attempted and has license to
take the narrative where they like.

Rarely, a card will have instructions for how to interpret a ✗✗ result.
These instructions should be executed, but might only be *part* of the
GM's move.

There is an exception to the GM moves on ✗ and ✗✗.  When the move card
has the tag *IMMEDIATE*, the GM does not add points to the *Bad
Bank* on a ✗ and they don't make a move on a ✗✗.

See the GM Guide for explanations of the *Bad Bank* and for a list of moves
the GM is allowed to make.


## Flips only happen when the situation is uncertain or risky

A GM only calls for a flip when the situation is uncertain or risky for
the character. If the outcome is certain, the GM may just narrate what
happens. Or they may ask you some clarifying questions.

Deckahedron World is a conversation. Different GMs will draw the line
of certainty at different places.

Consider a situation where the GM has described your character, Kresk,
waking up after making camp in a forest. Beside you is a squirrel nibbling
an acorn.

One response might be:

"Kresk wants that acorn! I Hack and Slash the squirrel!"

It would be bizzare, but completely within the rules for the GM to write
up some stats for the squirrel (1 Stamina, 1 attack power), and begin a
melee combat between Kresk and the squirrel, and ask you to flip Strength
to resolve the Hack and Slash move.

Perhaps better responses from the GM might be:

 * "As you raise your fist to smash the squirrel, it darts off into the
   forest, never to be seen again"
 * "How is Kresk going to overcome the squirrel's natural speed and reflexes?"
 * "You smash your fist down and flatten the rodent, strangely, it didn't
   even flinch. This odd behaviour has you wondering about the rumors you've
   heard about this forest being enchanted..."

The GM doesn't always have to invoke a move and call for a flip.  But in
this example, the player literally names a move ("I Hack and Slash...").
That's a strong signal to the GM, and the GM is likely to follow strong
signals.

If you enjoy playing in a style where things flow like a conversation or
a story, from question to answer, from description to dialogue and back
around again, rather than pushing a limited set of buttons laid out in
front of you, try playing without naming the moves. Just describe what your
character does in a natural way.

"Kresk wants that acorn! I slam my fist down on the squirrel!"


# Combat - Stamina/Harm/Wounds

Here are rules to determine when your character is able to endure
exertion and injury to keep moving forward or when they're completely
spent and collapsed in a heap.

When a character is in a fight, they are running, dodging, striking, and
being struck and assailed by their foe.  All of this stuff is scary and
exhausting. So a character gets weaker the longer they're in this
exchange, even if they're dodging every blow.

This weakening is represented by cards from your Deckahedron being lost
into your *Exhaustion pile*.

Think of a boxing match or a mixed martial arts match. During the later
rounds, the athletes are worn down, don't jump around the ring with as
much vigor, and drop their guard more frequently. The contest is not
always decided with a knockout punch, it often comes down to who can
better endure the exertion.

By default, your character has 10 Stamina points. When your character
loses all 10, they are incapacitated.

## Phases

When your character gets attacked or falls victim to some other danger,
you have choices about exactly how they are affected. They may dodge,
and just lose Stamina, they may stand stubbornly against a blow,
taking Harm to perhaps absorb the blow with their armour (or with their
face), or they may be wounded by the attack.

The **first phase** is rolling dice to arrive at a number. This number
is called the *attack power*.

The **second phase** is deciding how to split that number among 3
categories, Stamina, Harm, or Wounds.

The **third phase** is optional: absorbing some points using any relevant
move cards and item cards.

Finally, the **fourth phase**: you interpret those results into the
narrative.  Did your character dive into the dirt?  Did they take a punch
to the jaw and respond with a bloodied grin?  Did the spear bounce right
off their steel breastplate?

### First Phase

When your character suffers the consequences of violence, you roll dice to get
a number. This number is called the *attack power*.

### Second Phase

If you don't split up the *attack power*, it translates directly into Stamina
points. So by default, your character loses that amount of Stamina points.

Let's say your character was attacked with a sword and the dice were rolled
and summed up to 7.  The simplest thing is to lose 7 Stamina points.

But maybe you only have 7 Stamina points left in your deck, and you don't
want your character to be incapacitated. You have a couple options:

 * Turn *attack power* into Harm tokens at a rate of 3-for-1
 * Turn *attack power* into Wound tokens at a rate of 6-for-1

For example, you may split the attack power of 7 into:

 * 4 Stamina points
 * 1 Harm token

You may even do that twice, splitting the attack power of 7 into:

 * 1 Stamina point
 * 2 Harm tokens

Another option is to take a Wound, using a rate of 6-for-1.
In our example, you may split the attack power of 7 into:

 * 1 Stamina point
 * 1 Wound token

Note: as described later, taking Wound and Harm tokens can sometimes also
cause loss of Stamina points.


## Stamina / Exhaustion

Characters have 10 Stamina points.  These points are represented by
cards in your Deckahedron with a Stamina symbol

![Cards with and without Stamina symbol](images/with_without_stamina.png)

To win at combat, a character's foes must be subdued or pacified before the
player's Deckahedron has been emptied of Stamina points.

When you are instructed to lose a Stamina point, you may absorb it
using any relevant move cards and item cards, otherwise:

 1. reveal cards in your Deckahedron until you find a card with a Stamina symbol
 2. put that card aside, face-up in your *Exhaustion pile*
 3. the other revealed cards go into your *discard pile*

![Component layout](images/component_layout.png)

You should put an Exhaustion token on top of the *Exhaustion pile* to
distinguish it from your *discard pile*. But, unlike Harm and Wound tokens,
you don't have to put an Exhaustion token on the pile for each Stamina point
lost, that's what the cards are for.

![Exhaustion token](images/component_exhaustion.png)

(So, if you were instructed to lose 3 Stamina points, you add 3 cards
with Stamina symbols onto your Exhaustion pile)

If searching through their Deckahedron does not yield a card with a Stamina
symbol, the player **must** reshuffle their *discard pile* into the
Deckahedron and continue searching.

Note: Players *may* choose to reshuffle their *discard pile* back into the
Deckahedron *before* searching for Stamina points.

If there are no Stamina points in the Deckahedron *or* the *discard pile*,
then all 10 must be in the *Exhaustion pile*. In this case, the character
is *incapacitated* and can take no further actions.
It is up to the GM to decide what this incapacitation means - whether
the character is dead, unconscious, or just unable to stand or move. The
GM has rules for this, see the GM Guide.


## Harm

Think of that boxing match again.  If Stamina represents dancing, ducking,
and dodging, then Harm represents landing a blow.
These rules are also for representing mental strain that is so significant
that the negative effects last for a while.

When you are instructed to take a Harm token, you may absorb it
using any relevant move cards and item cards, otherwise:

 * **If you already have 2 Harm tokens on your Exhaustion pile**:
   - Take a *Wound* instead
 * **Otherwise**:
   1. Lose a Stamina point
   2. Place a *Harm token* on your *Exhaustion pile*

![Harm token](images/component_harm.png)

## Wounds

Getting wounded sucks, and when wounded, all intelligent creatures seek
to cure their condition as a very high priority.

When you are instructed to take a Wound token, you may absorb it
using any relevant move cards and item cards, otherwise:

 * **If you already have 2 wounds**:
   - the character is incapacitated
 * **Otherwise**:
   - the GM describes how the character was wounded
   - Lose a Stamina point
   - Place a *Wound token* on your *Exhaustion pile*
   - Place a *Wound card* in your *discard pile*. It will now start cycling
     between your Deckahedron and your *discard pile*.

![Wound token](images/component_wound.png)

### A Wound Card

![Image of Wound card](images/wound_200.png) |

Having a *Wound card* in your Deckahedron causes some nasty effects.

Whenever you **flip** and reveal a wound card, follow these rules:

 * Say or act out the gutteral noise emitted by your character
 * You must immediately stop flipping (eg, if you were
   instructed you to "flip 3", you stop short once you hit
   the wound card - resolve the move with only the card(s) you flipped.
   This overrides the **Complete Flip Rule**)
 * Lose a Stamina point


# Speed/Equip/Wealth

Your character has a movement speed,
a certain lightness-of-foot,
they carry a certain amount of equipment and items,
and they carry a certain amount of wealth.
These attributes are tracked with the Speed/Equip/Wealth system.
The more equipment and wealth carried, the lower their speed.

Daily-use amounts of money and food are not tracked. It is assumed
your character will always be able to scrounge a meal somehow.

Movement speed is not an exact measurement in meters-per-second.
It will matter when attempting moves where being laden with loot and gear
matters. Particularly moves with the tag "UNENCUMBERED".
When your speed goes below 4, you may not perform any "UNENCUMBERED" moves.

You have 6 tokens that can be allocated between 3 spots on your
character sheet (Speed, Equip, Wealth) and Item cards.

If you don't want to carry any items, equipment or wealth, you can
put all 6 tokens on Speed.

Tokens represent weight or difficulty to carry, when they're not on speed.

Some Item cards require more than 1 token.

The GM may interpret a Speed of 0 as limiting a character's gait to walking.

# SESSION 2 RULES
---

# More Moves - Take a Breather, Rest, Seek Help

## Taking a Breather

**Taking a Breather** is a move that a character can take during combat.
This action allows a character to regain Stamina points.

The player may use either Intelligence or Dexterity to perform the **Take a
Breather** action.

If they use Intelligence, they say how they execute a tactic or
recognize a favourable position that lets them gather their breath
and their wits. Then they flip a card.

If they use Dexterity, they say how they maneuver into a safe position
that offers some temporary safety. Then they flip a card and follow the
instructions on the card to see how many Stamina they regain.

Note: "regain Stamina" may be done either by taking cards from the
*Exhaustion pile* and putting them into the *discard pile*, or by discarding
Exhaustion tokens.

When taking cards from the *Exhaustion pile*, the player may choose any cards
they want.

    GM Note:
    When appropriate for the narrative (e.g. when there's a scene transition
    and the characters are just walking down a hallway), the GM may prompt the
    players to **Take a Breather** as an IMMEDIATE move.


## Resting

*Resting* is an action that a character may take when they are out of combat,
not travelling, and have several hours to devote to rest (sleeping qualifies).

 * Step 1: Return all *Exhaustion* tokens to the supply
 * Step 2: Count the *Harm* and *Wound* tokens on your *Exhaustion pile*
 * Step 3: Keep that many cards (player choses which ones) in your
   *Exhaustion pile*, put the rest into your *discard pile*
 * Step 4: Return one *Harm* token to the supply

Note: Time devoted to *Resting* cannot also be devoted to learning skills,
studying with a teacher, or any other action that takes mental or physical
effort.

When resting, magic items regain all charges, up to their maximum capacity.
Remove all white-side red cards on your magic items.

You may gird all your armour, where applicable.
Remove all Harm and Wound tokens from your armour cards.

## Seek Help

*Seeking Help* is an action that a character may take when they are in a
peaceful environment where external resources with healing powers are
available.

Eg, if they are in a primitive camp posessing medicine men or a
contemporary city with doctors and hospitals or a tranquil oasis infused
with healing magic.

When you spend a day healing:

 * Step 1: Describe your character's healing experience
 * Step 2: Return all *Exhaustion* tokens to the supply
 * Step 3: Return all *Harm* tokens to the supply
 * Step 4: Count the *Wound* tokens on your *Exhaustion pile*
 * Step 5: Keep that many cards (player choses which ones) in your
   *Exhaustion pile*, put the rest into your *discard pile*
 * Step 6: Return one *Wound* token and one *Wound card* to the supply

As with *Resting*, time spent *Seeking Help* cannot also be used in
activities that take effort.

Magic items regain all charges, up to their maximum capacity.
Remove all white-side red cards on your magic items.

You may gird all your armour, where applicable.
Remove all Harm and Wound tokens from your armour cards.


## More Moves - Run, Shop, Sharpen and Stitch

### Bravely Run Away

### Shop / Procure

Make mundane items - here's the process... TODO

Don't hand a player a card they can't use because they don't have the
requirements.

## Armor, weapons

Damage to items is represented as black-side red cards

#### Armour Table

Name             | token cost  | spots                | notes
-----------------|-------------|----------------------|---------
Leather Armour   | 1           | 2 Harm               |
_ Armour         | 2           | 2 Harm, 1 Harm/Wound |
Plate Armour     | 3           | 3 Harm/Wound         | requires help to don / doff


### Sharpen and Stitch

Damage to items is represented as black-side red cards


# More Moves - Use a Magic Item, Entreat the Blood-Bound, Channel the Living Light

Ask that player "Who is the Blood-Bound"?

    GM Note: this is a great way to stretch your improv muscles. Say "Yes,
    and..." no matter if they identify the Blood-Bound as tiny, parasitic
    insects or as monstrous, extradimensional dark gods.


# Making your own character

Spread out A, B, C cards, take turns picking

Items - 2 mundane items or 1 magic item

"Use a Magic Item" move gives you 2 magic items

"Channel the Living Light" move gives you Sigil of the Living Light

"Entreat the Blood-Bound" move gives you Blade of Echoes

A player inevitably asks why the magic amulet or ring they've created,
a trinket that is normally a couple grams, reduces their speed.  At that point
the GM should ask them a question, "Yes, why does it weigh you down? What
about magic in this world, or what about your character makes them
especially burdened by magical items?"


### Fitting the fiction

One of the joys of Deckahedron World is **building** your character up from
a scrappy adventurer to a force to be reckoned with.

Explain that the characters start out as "scrappy adventurers" that are not
much more powerful than a common villager.  They've got an edge over
regular folk, (their special abilities) but they're not mechanically that
much stronger.  Encourage your players to choose backstories that fit
where the characters are, mechanically.

Avoid the situation of a hulking, 7 foot tall barbarian, with a
rich history of warring and slaughtering enemies, who gets beat up by a farmer
with a shovel and his pet goat.

This doesn't mean don't let the player create the barbarian character.  It
means, if they do, find some fictional justification (drunkard? battle-worn?
magically cursed?) that they're currently at a "scrappy adventurer" level.


# Move Levels

Some Move cards have icons on them that indicate "levels". These levels
represent how good your character is at that skill. For example, the move
Pick Pockets has 5 icons.

![Pick Pockets card](images/pick_pockets_card.png)

These are the "move levels" for Pick Pockets.
From left to right, these icons are called:

 * ![2 red symbol](images/move_level_2_red.png) wild or "2 red"
 * ![1 red symbol](images/move_level_1_red.png) novice or "1 red"
 * ![base level](images/move_level_base_level.png) "base level"
 * ![1 green symbol](images/move_level_1_green.png) expert or "1 green"
 * ![2 green symbol](images/move_level_2_green.png) master or "2 green"

If you chose Pick Pockets during character creation, you would receive
the card and your character would be "studied" in the skill.
The word "STUDY" is over "base level", so that's the level you would
start at.

Note: some moves, like Void Transfusion, don't start you off at the base
level.

## Increased Move Levels

Later, you can go up a level in Pick Pockets. Either by using the Study
Under a Master move, or when you resolve a Pick Pockets flip and happen
to get a *green token card*.
See [Green token cards](#other-flip-complications-green-token-cards)

![Green card](images/green_card_black.png)

Take a green card, and put it on top of the move card. Put the green
card black-side-up.

With Pick Pockets leveled up, any time you perform that move in the future,
you will add an advantage card when you flip.

Because the Pick Pockets card shows the "2 green" icon, you can repeat this
process again later, which would let you add 2 advantage cards when you flip.

## Decreased Move Levels

But what about the 2 "red" levels?

In Deckahedron World, any character can attempt any move that is performed
by flipping Str, Dex, or Int -- even if the player doesn't have that move
card!

For any such moves, all characters start at the lowest level shown on the
card.  So every character is "wild" or "novice" at every skill that is
tested by flipping Int, Str, or Dex.

Every character, at any time, can attempt to hit two opponents in combat
(via Goreography). Every character can attempt to cast a spell (via
Fundamental Magic). But, their odds are very low.

You can attempt moves even if you don't meet the requirements shown.

Just as the "expert" and "master" levels cause the flip to be done with
advantage, the "wild" and "novice" levels cause the flip to be done with
disadvantage.

 * ![2 red symbol](images/move_level_2_red.png) flip with 2 levels of disadvantage
 * ![1 red symbol](images/move_level_1_red.png) flip with 1 level of disadvantage

If you perfrom a "wild" level move, and you resolve that flip with a
*green token card*, you can use that card to graduate to "novice" level.

![Red card](images/red_card_black.png)

If you choose to do so, take the move card and a red card. Place the red card
on top of the move card, black-side-up.


## More Moves - Study Under a Master, Craft a Weapon

### Study Under a Master

![SUaM card](images/move_study_under_a_master.png)

This is the move by which your character becomes a powerful force in
the world.

When your character is in a steading (a villiage, city, etc. -- any safe
place where resources and commerce present themselves), you can spend 2 green
tokens to either:

 * Increase the level of a move you already have
   (See [Move Levels](#move_levels)
 * Take a new move card from the supply

If you want to take a move card that another player already has or one that
was scribbled over in a previous campaign, or just has been ruined by spilled
beer, you can copy the text onto a new card.

![requirements](images/move_requirements.png)

Some moves have requirements. These are illustrated as green circles,
sometimes with a letter inside -- *R*, *F*, or *W*. Requirements are
sometimes separated by a slash, **/**, which means "or".

For example, using the Study Under a Master move can gain you the card
Fundamental Magic only if you have two green circles or one *W* circle.

What, then, are these circles?

Take a look through the move cards and see that there are partial circles
printed on them - either in the corners or on the sides.

When you can arrange your own move cards together in such a way that a
circle is completed, you "have" a circle. If you can find an arrangement
that shows 2 circles, then you "have" 2 circles.

![circle arrangements](images/circle_arrangements.png)

If your card arrangement had the cards Pick Pockets and Not On My Turf
next to each other, you could complete an *R* circle. If you had
the Scent of Blood card instead of the Not On My Turf card, you could
arrange it next to Pick Pockets to complete a circle, but it would not
be an *R* circle or an *F* circle, it would just be a regular green
circle.

You do not have to keep your cards in this arrangement while you play,

#### The RECEIVE CARDS tag

Sometimes when you Study Under a Master, you end up with study aids.

When you gain the move card...    | You also take...
----------------------------------|------------------------------
Channel The Living Light          | Sigil of the Living Light
Entreat The Blood-Bound           | Blade of Echoes
Use a Magic Item                  | Any 2 magic item cards

You use the RECEIVE CARDS tag only when you gain a move card via Study
Under a Master. You do not use it when you gain competence with the
skill by flipping green token cards.


### Craft a Weapon

When crafting a weapon, ask how many red tokens it takes (ie, how much it
reduces a character's speed). The GM should weigh that cost against the
weapon's other features

---
# SESSION 3 RULES
---

## Level circles

At the beginning of a session, players should arrange their move cards
to count how many green circles they have.

![level cards](images/level_cards.png)

If you have a new green circle this session, you get to take a *Level card*.

Like move cards, level cards may also have requirements. Some require that you
have a certain amount of circles to access them.

![blessing cards](images/blessing_cards.png)

Some level cards will instruct you to take blessing cards.


# Addenda

If you add a 2nd magical effect to a weapon with Tool Twisting, it still only
has 1 maximum charge, no matter which effect you use.
