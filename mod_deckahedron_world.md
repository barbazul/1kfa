# Welcome to Role-Playing

Deckahedron World is a system for telling a story.  The authors of the story
are you and your friends, sitting around a table.

This story is improvisiational, interactive, and collaborative.

The rewards for playing are laughter and excitement while you play, and
warm conversations for years afterwards that start with "Remember that time
we were playing Deckahedron World and..."


## How to make a great story

Imagine the audience for this story is the inner children of all the players.
What evokes the feelings we had when we were children playing pretend? Can
you remember being 11 years old and watching a great Steven Spielberg movie?
Or maybe a crappy Sam Raimi movie?

You are going to collaborate with all the other players to make this story,
so when you add your parts, think of what will give your friends around the
table a thrill, put them in suspense, ratchet up their feelings of tension,
or make their jaws drop with awe.

Sometimes inner children get a big kick out of blood and guts.
Your inner child might be the one who giggled watching the Messandei / Grey
Worm scenes in HBO's Game of Thrones. If you don't know what topics
your friends consider "off-limits", it is a good idea to ask and tell before
you start playing.

The story that emerges from Deckahedron World is not a precisely crafted
thing. That's ok. It doesn't have to be high art or even a cartoon on Adult
Swim. It will get shaped by each player, and when your turn comes, you will
adapt, do your best improvisational "Yes, and", and see where it goes from
there. It might sound like chaos, but with some faith in your friends, you
will delight at how a the plot solidifies, and how real the characters
become.


## Specifically, What to do

Roles - GM, Player

GM: Know all the rules, say stuff.  Your domain is the world.
Players: 50% Say stuff, 25% Flip your Deckahedron, 12% Move tokens around,
12% Roll dice.  Your domain is your character.


# The Deckahedron

## GM: Examples for what to do on single ✗ results

 * Make a "soft" move
 * Give an opponent an extra Stamina point
 * Give an opponent +1 to the next time they do damage
 * Make a cost a bit more expensive
 * Make a treasure a bit less valuable
 * One of the character's resources gets cosmetically changed
 * **Bank** a point

## GM: Examples for what to do on ✗✗ results

 * Make a "soft" move
 * Make a "hard" move

## GM Moves

 * The Dungeon World moves
 * Increment the difficulty on ✗
 * "Call for an Ad-Hoc Challenge"
  - eg, "Something feels weird about this bridge. Flip Int to notice
    what the problem is"
    (It's implied that either ✔ or ✔✔ are needed to succeed)
  - eg, "Anyone who wants to race to the edge of the bridge before
    it collapses must have at least 2 speed and get ✔✔ on a Dex flip"
    (The GM is allowed to consider other aspects than just Int / Str / Dex)
  - eg, "You're all in the moat. Spend a green token and describe how
    your character learned to swim, or else begin thrashing and drowning.
    If you spend the green token, write 'swimming' on your character
    sheet."

 * On a *critical failure* flip, the GM can use 3 banked points to make
   an additional move
