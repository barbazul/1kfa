# Deckahedron Module: Deckahedron World

This is an adaptation of
[Dungeon World](http://www.dungeon-world.com/)
for the
[Deckahedron System](foundation.md)


# Purpose

Deckahedron World is a system for telling a story.  The authors of the story
are you and your friends, sitting around a table.  The audience for the
story is your inner children.

This story is improvisiational, interactive, and collaborative.


## Notes on audience

Just because the audience is inner child doesn't mean you're going for a "G"
rating.  Sometimes inner children get a big kick out of blood and guts.
Your inner child might be the one who giggled watching the Messandei / Grey
Worm scenes in the Game of Thrones TV series.



## GM: Examples for what to do on single ✗ results

 * Make a "soft" move
 * Give an opponent an extra Stamina point
 * Give an opponent +1 to the next time they do damage
 * Make a cost a bit more expensive
 * Make a treasure a bit less valuable
 * One of the character's resources gets cosmetically changed

## GM: Examples for what to do on ✗✗ results

 * Make a "soft" move
 * Make a "hard" move

## GM Moves

 * The Dungeon World moves
 * Increment the difficulty on ✗
 * "Call for an Ad-Hoc Challenge"
  - eg, "Something feels weird about this bridge. Flip Int to notice
    what the problem is"
    (It's implied that either ✔ or ✔✔ are needed to succeed)
  - eg, "Anyone who wants to race to the edge of the bridge before
    it collapses must have at least 2 speed and get ✔✔ on a Dex flip"
    (The GM is allowed to consider other aspects than just Int / Str / Dex)
  - eg, "You're all in the moat. Spend a green token and describe how
    your character learned to swim, or else begin thrashing and drowning"
