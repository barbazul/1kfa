# Welcome to Role-Playing

Deckahedron World is a system for telling a story.  The authors of the story
are you and your friends, sitting around a table.

This story is improvisiational, interactive, and collaborative.

The rewards for playing are laughter and excitement while you play, and
warm conversations for years afterwards that start with "Remember that time
we were playing Deckahedron World and..."


## How to make a great story

Imagine the audience for this story is the inner children of all the players.
What evokes the feelings we had when we were children playing pretend? Can
you remember being 11 years old and watching a great Steven Spielberg movie?
Or maybe a crappy Sam Raimi movie?

You are going to collaborate with all the other players to make this story,
so when you add your parts, think of what will give your friends around the
table a thrill, put them in suspense, ratchet up their feelings of tension,
or make their jaws drop with awe.

Sometimes inner children get a big kick out of blood and guts.
Your inner child might be the one who giggled watching the Messandei / Grey
Worm scenes in HBO's Game of Thrones. If you don't know what topics
your friends consider "off-limits", it is a good idea to ask and tell before
you start playing.

The story that emerges from Deckahedron World is not a precisely crafted
thing. That's ok. It doesn't have to be high art or even a cartoon on Adult
Swim. It will get shaped by each player, and when your turn comes, you will
adapt, do your best improvisational "Yes, and", and see where it goes from
there. It might sound like chaos, but with some faith in your friends, you
will delight at how a the plot solidifies, and how real the characters
become.


## Specifically, What to do

Roles - GM, Player

GM: Know all the rules, say stuff.  Your domain is the world.
Players: 50% Say stuff, 25% Flip your Deckahedron, 12% Move tokens around,
12% Roll dice.  Your domain is your character.

Player:

 * Describe your character and their actions
    * Refer to your moves to get ideas for your character
    * Act out their dialogue
    * Tell *how* they act
       - flourishes and stunts
       - their facial expressions, voice, and body language
    * Tell what they say / hear / see / smell / taste / feel
    * Describe their thoughts & memories
    * Chime in when they interact with / support the other characters

 * Tell parts of the story
    * Refer to your moves to see what boundaries you can push
    * Tell your character's backstory
    * Control hirelings and animal companions



```
p2-p3

# The Deckahedron

Inspect your Deckahedron.  You should have 20 cards.  There will be 4
symbols on the fronts and backs of the cards:

Name      | symbol                                  | odds                              | color  | rank
----------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------|-------
Anchor    | ![anchor symbol](images/anchor.png)     | indicates the weakest odds        | red    | rank 1
Bulb      | ![bulb symbol](images/bulb.png)         | indicates below average odds      | yellow | rank 2
Crescent  | ![crescent symbol](images/crescent.png) | indicates above average odds      | green  | rank 3
Dart      | ![dart symbol](images/dart.png)         | indicates the best odds           | blue   | rank 4

Shuffle your Deckahedron and place it face-down in front of you.

Whenever your character attempts something risky, where the outcome is
not certain, the GM will call on you to use your Deckahedron and "flip".

First, the GM will name the move you're attempting and which of your
character's attributes -- Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence -- you
will use to resolve the flip.

    GM Note: The attributes used to resolve a move are listed at the top
    of each card.  Sometimes a card will give the option of several
    attributes, like "Str / Dex".  You may need to ask the player for more
    detail about what they are attempting before calling for a flip.

![Illustration of rotating your Deckahedron](images/component_rotate.png)

Look at the attribute on your character sheet -- what symbol is it, Anchor,
Bulb, Crescent, or Dart? Rotate your Deckahedron so that the symbol is
facing forward (away from you). Then flip the top card forward (so that
when it's face-up, the symbol is facing forward)

![Illustration of flipping a card forward](images/component_flip.png)

The top of the flipped card will show ✗s or ✔s.

![Illustration of reading a card](images/component_read.png)

Finally, find the move card named by the GM and read its instructions.
It will tell you how the GM should interpret the ✗s and ✔s.

Put the face-up Deckahedron card in your *discard pile*.

## For example,

You're playing a character named Kresk.  You say:

> Kresk sees the pit of spikes in front of him, but isn't scared.
> He just takes a running start and mightily bounds over the pit,
> landing safely on the other side.

The GM might say to you:

> Ok, sounds good, but let's see if Kresk's legs are strong enough.
> Please flip Defy Danger with your Strength.

Look over at the character sheet and see that Kresk has rank 3
(Crescent) Strength. This means you would rotate your Deckahedron
so that the Crescent symbol is forward, then you would flip over
the top card.

Maybe you get a single ✔. The GM would use the instructions on the
Defy Danger card ("You do it, but there's a new complication") to
improvise what happens next:

> You leap through the air, landing with a thud on the other
> side of the pit, kicking up a cloud of dust on this forgotten
> jungle trail. As you rise to your feet, you notice it's more than
> dust that stirs, as you hear movement and a threatening rattle
> approaching from the pit. What do you do?

## Other ways to flip: Advantage / Disadvantage

Some flips are a little more complicated. Some moves in Deckahedron
World instruct you to "add an advantage card" or "flip with advantage".
Sometimes you will be given the opposite instruction, "add a
disadvantage card" or "flip with disadvantage".

### Advantage

With an advantage, you flip over your top card as usual, and then you
flip over the next card on the top of the Deckahedron.
Compare the results (the number of ✗s or ✔s)
and resolve the flip with the card that has the **best** result.

If it's a tie, you may choose whichever card to be the card that resolves
the flip.

All cards that got flipped face-up go in your *discard pile*.

#### Complete Flip Rule

You must flip over all the cards you were instructed to, even if the first
card shows ✔✔.


### Disadvantage

With a disadvantage, do the same thing, but use the **worst** result.

### Multiple Advantages / Disadvantages

For a given flip, you may be instructed to add two advantage cards or two
disadvantage cards.  This means you would flip **3 cards in total** and take
the **best** or **worst**, respectively.

No flip may use more than 3 cards in total, so adding advantage cards past 2
is just ignored.

Sometimes you're in a situation where you are instructed to both
"flip with advantage" and "flip with disadvantage". To resolve any move,
simply add up all the advantages, and then subtract all the disadvantages
to arrive at your sum of advantage or disadvantage.
The maximum is two extra cards, so if the sum is -3, you only
flip with two disadvantage cards.


## Other flip complications: Green token cards

Some of your Deckahedron cards have a green token symbol in the middle.
After a flip is resolved by a card showing a green token symbol,
you have a choice:

 * Take a green token (these can be spent to perform certain moves)
 * Go up one level in the move you just performed (see Move Levels)

You may only do this when the card *resolves* a flip.

## Other flip complications: Wound cards

Sometimes you will flip over a Wound card.  See the Combat chapter.


## Reshuffling

At any time before a flip, or after a flip is resolved, you can take your
*discard pile* and shuffle it back into your Deckahedron.

Whenever your Deckahedron is down to 5 or fewer cards, you **must** take
your *discard pile* and shuffle it back into your Deckahedron.


## GM Notes: What to do on flips

When a player is performing a move, you should read the move card so that
you can interpret the result of the flip. Usually ✔✔ means an unfettered
success, and single ✔ means success, but with complication. 

When the result is a single ✗, it is sometimes the same as a single ✔, but
often it is slightly worse. When a flip results in a single ✗, even when
the move card says it has the same narrative effect as a single ✔, you
should add a point to your *Bad Bank*.  See the GM Guide.

When the result is ✗✗, it is your turn to make a move.  You narrate the
consequences of the move the player just attempted and you have license to
take the narrative where you'd like.  See the GM Guide.

There is an exception to the GM moves on ✗ and ✗✗.  When the move card
has the tag *IMMEDIATE*, the GM does not add points to their *Bad
Bank* on a ✗ and they don't make a move on a ✗✗.

### GM: Examples for spending points from the *Bad Bank*

 * Make a "soft" move
 * Give a foe an extra Stamina point
 * Give a foe +1 to the next time they do damage
 * Make a cost a bit more expensive
 * Make a treasure a bit less valuable
 * One of the character's resources gets cosmetically changed

## GM Moves

 * The Dungeon World moves
 * Player loses confidence in the skill they just tried.  Put a white-side red card on it until they use it and flip a ✔ or ✔✔
 * "Call for an Ad-Hoc Challenge"
  - eg, "Something feels weird about this bridge. Flip Int to notice
    what the problem is"
    (It's implied that either ✔ or ✔✔ are needed to succeed)
  - eg, "Anyone who wants to race to the edge of the bridge before
    it collapses must have at least 2 speed and get ✔✔ on a Dex flip"
    (The GM is allowed to consider other aspects than just Int / Str / Dex)
  - eg, "You're all in the moat. Spend a green token and describe how
    your character learned to swim, or else begin thrashing and drowning.
    If you spend the green token, write 'swimming' on your character
    sheet."

 * On a *critical failure* flip, the GM can use 3 banked points to make
   an additional move


## GM responsibility: moving the spotlight

Never let a player's turn to be inconsequential. A player might wait
10 minutes for their friends' moves, so if their whole turn in the
spotlight ends with "nothing happens" this game will be very unfun.
Give them an opportunity for something. This doesn't mean they have
to slay a demon on every turn, merely getting a big laugh can
be "something".

Remember, this is a collaborative story.  Laughter and excitement
are the rewards for everyone.

# Combat - Stamina/Harm/Wounds - GM: moving the spotlight

Here are rules that tell you when your character is able to endure
exertion and injury to keep moving forward or tell you when your
character is completely spent and collapses in a heap.

When a character is in a fight, they are running, dodging, striking, and
being struck and assailed by their foe.  All of this stuff is scary and
exhausting. So a character will get weaker the longer they're in this
exchange, even if they're dodging every blow.

This weakening is represented by cards from your Deckahedron being lost
into your *Exhaustion pile*.

Think of a boxing match or a mixed martial arts match. During the later
rounds, the athletes are worn down, don't jump around the ring with as
much vigor, and drop their guard more frequently. The contest is not
always decided with a knockout punch, it often comes down to who can
better endure the exertion.

## Phases

When your character gets attacked or falls victim to some other danger,
you will have choices about exactly how they are affected. They may dodge,
and just lose Stamina, they may take Harm to absorb the blow with their
armour (or with their face), or they may be wounded by the damage.

The **first phase** is rolling dice to arrive at a number.

The **second phase** is deciding how to split that number among 3
categories, Stamina, Harm, or Wounds.

The **third phase** is optional: absorbing some points using any relevant
move cards and item cards.

Finally, the **fourth phase**: you interpret those results into the 
narrative.  Did your character dive into the dirt?  Did they take a punch
to the jaw and respond with a bloodied grin?  Did the spear bounce right
off their steel breastplate?

### Second Phase

When you are hit in combat, you roll dice to get a number. If you choose
not to split that dice result number, by default, you will lose that amount
of Stamina points.

Let's say your character was hit by a sword and the dice were rolled and
summed up to 7.  The simplest thing would be to lose 7 Stamina points.

But maybe you only have 7 Stamina points left in your deck, and you don't
want your character to be incapacitated. You have a couple options:
 * Take a Harm token to reduce the dice result by 3
 * Take a Wound token to reduce the dice result by 6

For example, you could subtract the dice result by **3** and take 
**1 Harm token**.
Thus you would split the dice result of 7 into:
 * 4 Stamina points
 * 1 Harm token

You could even do that twice, subtracting a total of 6 from the dice result
to take 2 Harm tokens.
Thus you would split the dice result of 7 into:
 * 1 Stamina point
 * 2 Harm tokens

Another option would be to take a Wound. You could subtract **6** from the dice
result to take **1 Wound token**.
Thus you would split the dice result of 7 into:
 * 1 Stamina point
 * 1 Wound token

Note: as described later, taking Wound and Harm tokens can sometimes also
cause loss of Stamina points.

## Stamina / Exhaustion

Characters have 10 Stamina points.  These points are represented by
cards in your Deckahedron with a Stamina symbol

![Cards with and without Stamina symbol](images/with_without_stamina.png)

To win at combat, a character's foes must be subdued or pacified before the
player's Deckahedron has been emptied of Stamina points.

When you are instructed to lose a Stamina point, you may absorb it
using any relevant move cards and item cards, otherwise:

 1. reveal cards in your Deckahedron until you find a card with a Stamina symbol
 2. put that card aside, face-up in your *Exhaustion pile*
 3. the other revealed cards go into your *discard pile*

![Component layout](images/component_layout.png)

You should put an Exhaustion token on top of the *Exhaustion pile* to
distinguish it from your *discard pile*.

![Exhaustion token](images/component_exhaustion.png)

(So, if you were instructed to lose 3 Stamina points, you would add 3 cards
with Stamina symbols onto your Exhaustion pile)

If searching through their Deckahedron does not yield a card with a Stamina
symbol, the player **must** reshuffle their *discard pile* into the
Deckahedron and continue searching.

Note: Players *may* choose to reshuffle their *discard pile* back into the
Deckahedron *before* searching for Stamina points.

If there are no Stamina points in the Deckahedron *or* the *discard pile*,
then all 10 must be in the *Exhaustion pile*. In this case, the character
is *incapacitated* and can take no further actions.
It is up to the GM to decide what this incapacitation means - whether
the character is dead, unconscious, or just unable to stand or move. The
GM has rules for this, see the GM Guide.


## Harm

Think of that boxing match again.  If Stamina represents dancing, ducking,
and dodging, then Harm represents landing a blow.
These rules are also for representing mental strain that is so significant
that the negative effects will last for a while.

When you are instructed to take a Harm token, you may absorb it
using any relevant move cards and item cards, otherwise:

 * **If you already have 2 Harm tokens on your Exhaustion pile**:
   - Take a *Wound* instead
 * **Otherwise**:
   1. Lose a Stamina point
   2. Place a *Harm token* on your *Exhaustion pile*

![Harm token](images/component_harm.png)

## Wounds

Getting wounded sucks, and when wounded, all intelligent creatures seek
to cure their condition as a very high priority.

When you are instructed to take a Wound token, you may absorb it
using any relevant move cards and item cards, otherwise:

 * **If you already have 2 wounds**:
   - the character is incapacitated
 * **Otherwise**:
   - the GM will describe how the character was wounded
   - Lose a Stamina point
   - Place a *Wound token* on your *Exhaustion pile*
   - Place a *Wound card* in your *discard pile*. It will now start cycling
     between your Deckahedron and your *discard pile*.

![Wound token](images/component_wound.png)

### A Wound Card

![Image of Wound card](images/wound_200.png) |

Having a *Wound card* in your Deckahedron causes some nasty effects.

Whenever you **flip** and reveal a wound card, follow these rules:

 * Say or act out the gutteral noise emitted by your character
 * You must immediately stop flipping (eg, if your the move
   instructed you to "flip 3", you would stop short once you hit
   the wound card - resolve the move with only the card(s) you flipped.
   This overrides the **Complete Flip Rule**)
 * Lose a stamina point


# Flipping Green - get a green token


# More Moves - Do a Flashback, Critical Flip


# More Moves - Take a Breather, Rest, Heal

## Taking a Breather

**Taking a Breather** is a move that a character can take during combat.
This action allows a character to regain Stamina points.

The player can use either Intelligence or Dexterity to perform the **Take a
Breather** action.

If they use Intelligence, they say how they execute a tactic or
recognize a favourable position that lets them gather their breath
and their wits. Then they flip a card.

If they use Dexterity, they say how they maneuver into a safe position
that offers some temporary safety. Then they flip a card and follow the
instructions on the card to see how many Stamina they regain.

Note: "regain Stamina" can be done either by taking cards from the
*Exhaustion pile* and putting them into the *discard pile*, or by discarding
Exhaustion tokens.

When taking cards from the *Exhaustion pile*, the player may choose any cards
they want.

    GM Note:
    When appropriate for the narrative (e.g. when there's a scene transition
    and the characters are just walking down a hallway), the GM may prompt the
    players to **Take a Breather** as an IMMEDIATE move.


## Resting

*Resting* is an action that a character can take when they are out of combat,
not travelling, and have several hours to devote to rest (sleeping qualifies).

 * Discard all *Exhaustion tokens*
 * Discard one *Harm token*
 * Count the remaining *Harm* and *Wound* tokens on your *Exhaustion pile*
 * Keep that many cards (chosen at random) in your *Exhaustion pile*, put
   the rest into your *discard pile*

Note: Time devoted to *Resting* cannot also be devoted to learning skills,
studying with a teacher, or any other action that takes mental or physical
effort.

When resting, magic items regain all charges, up to their maximum capacity.
Remove all white-side red cards on your magic items.


## Healing

*Healing* is an action that a character can take when they are in a peaceful
environment and have time and resources to spend on self-care.

Eg, if they are in a primitive camp posessing medicine men or a
contemporary city with doctors and hospitals or a tranquil oasis infused
with healing magic.

Healing can also be effected by equipment and skills.
See [Equipment](mod_speed_equipment_money.md) and [Characters](mod_characters.md)

When you spend a day healing:

 * Describe your character's healing experience
 * Discard all *Exhaustion tokens*
 * Discard all *Harm tokens*
 * Discard one *Wound token*
 * Count the remaining *Wound* tokens on your *Exhaustion pile*
 * Keep that many cards (chosen at random) in your *Exhaustion pile*, put
   the rest into your *discard pile*

As with *Resting*, time spent *Healing* cannot also be used in activities that
take effort.


# Speed/Equipment/Wealth

## More Moves - Run, Shop, Good Thing I Brought..., Sharpen and Stitch

# Mundane Items

## Armor, weapons

# More Moves - Use a Magic Item, Entreat the Blood-Bound, Channel the Living Light

Ask that player "Who is the Blood-Bound"?

    GM Note: this is a great way to stretch your improv muscles. Say "Yes,
    and..." no matter if they identify the Blood-Bound as tiny, parasitic
    insects or as monstrous, extradimensional dark gods.

# Starting a game

## Sarukkan's Chamber

## Making your own character

Spread out A, B, C cards, take turns picking

Items - 2 mundane items or 1 magic item

"Use a Magic Item" move gives you 2 magic items

A player will inevitably ask why the magic amulet or ring they've created,
a trinket that would normally be light, reduces their speed.  At that point
the GM should ask them a question, "Yes, why does it weigh you down? What
about magic in this world, or what about your character makes them
especially burdened by magical items?"

# Leveling Up

## Flipping green

## Study / Craft

When crafting a weapon, ask how many red tokens it takes (ie, how much it
reduces a character's speed). The GM should weigh that cost against the
weapon's other features

## Level circles
