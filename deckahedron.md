# The Deckahedron

The **Deckahedron** is a deck of 20 square cards.

These cards are designed to be used with role-playing games, for actions
where typically dice are used.

## Problem : Arithmetic Is Annoying

In **Dungeons and Dragons**, to see if your character succeeds or
fails at an action, typically you would roll a 20-sided die (d20), then take
the resulting value and add or subtract bonuses or penalties for a new value,
and then check that new value against a *difficulty value*.

Many other role-playing games follow the same formula.  Roll, add/subtract,
compare to the difficulty of the action.

In this way, the odds of success fall along a statistical "curve".

The downside is all the arithmetic. The process *can* be learned and
mastered. Some well-practiced players may not even see the problem because
the arithmetic has become an afterthought. But it is often cumbersome for new
players. Even players familiar with the mechanic sometimes complain that
the mental math breaks the "flow" of the game.

The Deckahedron is designed to replace this process with a simpler one.
Typically, the new process is:

 * Flip a card
 * Look at the side of the card that corresponds to the attribute being used
 * The result of the action is successful if ✔ symbols are shown
 * The result of the action is failure if ✗ symbols are shown

This works because the statistical curve is "baked-in" to the deck of 20
cards.
