# Deckahedron Module: Leveling Up

`TODO`

Levels are represented by set collection.

As you learn skills, you get cards.  If the skill cards have partial
circles on them, you arrange them so the circles link up.  When
you gain a card that completes a circle, then you get to choose
a "Level bonus" token, and put that token in the circle.

The Level bonus token's border must match the border of the circle
you just competed.  Eg, you can't take fighter Lvl 1 bonus token if
you don't have an "F" circle to put it on.

The bonus tokens have little icons in them that have meanings.  They
could be new actions, skills, or attributes.

The circle at level 6 gives the ability to move a stat up a level

# TODO: ideas for level progression

## Thief

 * Hide your green tokens from the GM
 * Reveal that an NPC is actually on a different side than assumed
 * What was thought to be a critical resource is actually a decoy,
   bluff, or an illusion
